</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of the girls who will read this book
have already made the acquaintance of Betty
Wales, and know all about her adventures at
Harding College, from her rollicking freshman
days to the time when she was a “grave
and reverend senior”&mdash;and was always being
mistaken for a freshman, nevertheless. Mary
Brooks graduated from Harding a year before
Betty, and she always considered that this
gave her the privilege of patronizing her
friends in 19&mdash;, Betty’s class. Madeline joined
19&mdash; in its sophomore year, and Babbie Hildreth
(she and her friends Babe and Bob were
known collectively as the three B’s) was
another of the shining lights of that famous
class. She and Madeline and Betty planned
the tea-room, though only in fun, during a
trip abroad that came as a grand finale to their
college days. You can read all about that
in “Betty Wales, B. A.,” which also tells
about Mary Brooks’s “impromptu” wedding.
But you will have to go back to “Betty
Wales, Senior,” to find out how Mary’s “little
friends” discovered that she was interested in
Professor Hinsdale. There are a lot of other
things that you will want to know about
Betty and her friends&mdash;if you like them&mdash;in
“Betty Wales, Freshman,” “Betty Wales,
Sophomore,” and “Betty Wales, Junior.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> very loveliest part of going abroad is
coming home again!” laughed Betty Wales,
trying to kiss her mother, hug the smallest
sister, and rush into her father’s outstretched
arms all at one and the same minute. Fortunately
Will and Nan had had their turns at
the station, and the smallest sister’s kitten had
run away at the critical moment; otherwise
matters would have been hopelessly complicated.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll always feel just that way,
dear,” said Mrs. Wales.</p>

<p>“We’re mighty glad to have you back,
child,” added father, with a queer little
catch in his merry voice.</p>

<p>“Have you got anything for me in your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>trunk, Betty?” demanded the smallest sister,
who was a very practical young person.</p>

<p>“Lots of things, dear,” Betty assured her
gaily, “and something for the kitten, even if
she isn’t here to say ‘how do you do’ to
me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have dinner first,” mother insisted
laughingly.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll all sit around in an expectant
circle and watch Betty unpack,”
added Nan.</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped being expectant since I’ve
heard the news,” put in Will. “She’s
brought back money. How’s that, dad, for
one of the Wales family?”</p>

<p>“Well, there weren’t any emergencies,”
Betty explained earnestly. “So of course I
could save my emergency fund.”</p>

<p>“Seeing something that she wants in a
store-window is Nan’s definition of an emergency,”
declared Will.</p>

<p>“What’s yours?” retorted Nan. “Besides,
haven’t I turned over a new leaf this month,
and isn’t it this very next week that I’m to
begin earning my own bread and butter and
jam?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean, Nan?” demanded
Betty in amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, your college course and your trip
abroad have bankrupted father,” laughed
Nan; and then, seeing Betty’s expression of
genuine distress, “No, dear, only we are an
expensive family and hopelessly extravagant,
as Will says, and times are bad. Anyway I’m
tired of rushing around, studying and traveling
and amusing myself. So when two of the
girls in my class, who have a school in Boston,
offered me a job, I jumped at it. Don’t
you think I’m likely to make a stunning
school-ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Betty assured her promptly.
“You’re so bright. But I thought you hated
Boston, and you always said that Ethel was
so silly to drudge at teaching when she didn’t
need to.”</p>

<p>“But can’t I change my mind?” asked
Nan gaily.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.” Betty looked in a puzzled
way around the family group. “Only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only dinner is ready,” suggested mother
again; and all through the meal the talk was
about Betty’s voyage home, with its exciting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>storm, and her visit to Harding, with Georgia’s
gargoyle party and Mary Brooks’s absurd methods
of housekeeping as main features of interest.
The minute dinner was over the smallest
sister caught Betty around the waist, and
whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>“All right, dear,” Betty promised. “You
shan’t have to wait another minute to see
what I’ve brought you.” And they all, except
Will and Mr. Wales, who preferred the
library and the evening papers, adjourned to
Betty’s room to help unpack.</p>

<p>“Such a mess!” she sighed, as she uncovered
the top tray. “You see I took out some
things on shipboard, and then Mary and
Roberta and Bob and Georgia all wanted to
see what we’d brought home, and of course I
was in too much of a rush to put things back
straight. Besides, it wasn’t worth while to
be particular, when all my clothes need
mending or pressing or something. Move
back, little sister, so I can have room for the
Katie pile. It’s going to be about all Katie
pile, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Is the Katie pile what you want Katie to
fix in the sewing-room?” inquired the smallest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
sister. “Because we haven’t got Katie any
more, so you’ll have to call it something else.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got Katie any more!” Betty’s
face wore an expression of blank amazement.
“Has Katie left?”</p>

<p>“I thought we could get on without her,”
Mrs. Wales explained hastily. “I have so little
to do, now that my girls are all grown up.
Dorothy is going to help me mend stockings
this winter, aren’t you, dear?”</p>

<p>The smallest sister nodded impressively.
“I’ll help you mend your Katie pile too,
Betty. Katie has gone to the Elingwoods’ to
live, and she likes it, but she says it’s not the
same thing, and when times are better she’ll
be glad of it, because then she’ll come right
back here.”</p>

<p>“You see it’s this queer horrid panic,
Betty,” Nan explained. “Father hasn’t
actually lost much, I imagine; but business is
bad, and so we’re trying to economize.”</p>

<p>“And you never told me!” Betty looked
reproachfully at her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales laughed. “No, dear. Why
should we? Anyway it’s all come up lately,
since we got back from the shore. Even now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>there’s really nothing to tell, except that everybody
is talking hard times and father’s business
is dull. I’m very sorry it happened this
season, because I meant you to be very gay
your first winter at home, and now we can’t
do much formal entertaining.”</p>

<p>Betty’s face clouded as she remembered a
house-party she had planned for the “Merry
Hearts.” Luckily, she hadn’t mentioned it;
it was to have been a grand surprise to everybody.
Then a horrible thought swept everything
else out of her head.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother dear,” she began, “perhaps I
ought to teach too, like Nan. I don’t believe
I could, ever in the world, but I suppose every
college girl ought to be able to, and I could try.”</p>

<p>“Betty Wales,” mother ordered solemnly,
“unpack your trunk just enough to satisfy
Dorothy’s curiosity, and then go to bed.
You’re worn out, and as nervous as a witch.
Just because I’ve decided not to keep a seamstress
in the house this winter, and Nan is tired
of society and jumps at an excuse to do a little
teaching, you decide that the family is on
the way to the poorhouse.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t only that&mdash;&mdash;” Betty stopped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>She had started to say that father looked
worried, and didn’t joke back at all when you
teased him; but perhaps that only seemed so
to-night because she was fatigued herself from
too much gaiety at Harding.</p>

<p>So she hunted out six assorted neck-bows
for the gray kitten, six hair ribbons from
Paris for the kitten’s small mistress, a Dutch
doll, and a long chain strung with tiny silver
charms, each with a story of its own; and
having assured the smallest sister that this
was only a beginning of the treasures she
might expect, Betty went to bed and dreamed
that she had lost her emergency fund under
the teacher’s desk in Nan’s schoolroom, and
had to teach a class in senior “English
Lit.” before she could get it back. But she
couldn’t remember when Shakespeare was
born, and the girls stood up on their desks
and waved their handkerchiefs and screamed,
and she waved too, because it was the Harvard-Cambridge
boat race on the Thames. No, it
was brother Will calling her to breakfast, and
little Dorothy saying in a sepulchral whisper,
“Oh, hush, Will! Mother said Betty was to
sleep over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Coming! Wouldn’t sleep over for anything!”
Betty called back, making a rush for
her bath.</p>

<p>It was such a jolly day. People kept dropping
in to say welcome home, and to tease
Nan about her “latest fad,” as everybody
called it. In the evening there was a regular
party of Betty’s and Will’s friends on the big
piazza, and before it was over Betty had
promised to help at six “coming-out” teas,
take part in one play, be on the committee to
get up another, join a morning French class
and a reading-club, and consider taking a
cross-country ride every Saturday afternoon as
long as the good weather lasted.</p>

<p>Up-stairs in her room she took down the
rose-colored satin dress she had bought in
Paris, and examined it approvingly. But one
simply couldn’t wear the same thing at six
receptions. There was her graduating dress,
of course, but styles had changed frightfully
since spring. If only Katie were here to use
her magic touch on the pink lace evening
gown that Bob had stepped on at class-supper!</p>

<p>“I never can mend it myself!” sighed
Betty. “I shall need another afternoon dress
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>anyway, and a suit, and I did want a new
riding habit. Mine is horribly rusty. I
wonder how careful about money we’ve got to
be. And I wonder if Will thought to bolt
the piazza door.”</p>

<p>She slipped on a kimono and crept softly
down the stairs, a slim, golden-haired ghost
in a trailing robe of silk and lace. Will
hadn’t locked the door. And there was a
light in the library, though it was long after
midnight.</p>

<p>“It’s Nan, probably, reading up things to
teach. I’ll go in and bother her and make
her come to bed.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t Nan. It was father, poring
over a big sheet of paper scrawled full of tiny
figures. Betty closed the door after her,
crept quietly across the room, and descended
precipitately upon the arm of her father’s
chair.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing here all
by yourself at this time of night, Father
Wales?” she demanded gaily.</p>

<p>Mr. Wales looked up at her, still frowning
absently, with a finger on his place among
the figures. “Nothing, daughter; just looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
over a contract that I wanted to do a little
estimating on before to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But it’s horribly late,” objected Betty.
“Think how sleepy you’ll be in the morning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales smiled faintly. “Shall I? Well,
run along to bed, so you won’t be sleepy too.”
And he was back at his figures again.</p>

<p>Betty watched him for a minute, dropped a
kiss on his puckered forehead, and slipped
softly away without a word.</p>

<p>“He’s just awfully worried,” she reflected,
as she went up-stairs. “Nan and mummy and
Will don’t realize how changed he is, because
they’ve been here right along. Why, in these
three months he’s a different person!” She
put the rose-colored satin dress carefully
back in its cheese-cloth covering. “I wonder
if we’re really going to be poor. Why,
this may be the first and the last Paris gown
I shall ever have! I know one thing. I’m
going to talk to father, and make him tell me
just how poor we are now. You can go ahead
so much better when you understand
things.”</p>

<p>But it was such a busy week, what with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>catching up the threads of the home life that
had been dropped for so long, helping Nan off,
and getting Dorothy started in school, that it
slipped by without the talk that Betty had
promised herself. On the evening of Nan’s
departure, however, her opportunity came.
Will had an engagement, mother was tired,
and Dorothy very sleepy; so only Mr. Wales
and Betty went with Nan to her train.</p>

<p>It was a fine September evening, and Betty
craftily suggested that they walk home. The
down-town streets were too noisy for serious
conversation, but out on the avenue Betty
plunged in at once.</p>

<p>“Father, you’re awfully worried. Please
tell me why.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales threw back his head and laughed.
“Goodness, Betty, but you come right to the
point! Suppose I deny that ‘awfully.’”</p>

<p>“You mean because it’s slang?” asked
Betty anxiously. “And isn’t it a good thing
to come right to the point?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that depend on the point, little
girl? Suppose it was a point you had never
expected to come to, and didn’t want to come
to,&mdash;what then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Betty’s face wore its most intent expression.
“But if you had come to it all the same,
father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better get away again as fast
as possible, and ask little girls not to bother
their heads about you in the meantime.”
Father’s tone was very brusque and final&mdash;the
one he used when he meant “no” and
was not going to change his mind, no matter
how much you teased.</p>

<p>“All right, father.” Betty tried not to
show that she felt hurt. “I won’t bother you
again. Only I thought that if I understood
perhaps I could help a little. I don’t think
mother really knows how much we ought to
try to save this winter, and I’m sure Nan and
Will don’t. You’ve always been so generous
and let us have just whatever we wanted. I
want lots of things just now, but I can be
happy without them.” Betty stopped suddenly,
not quite sure where she had meant to
come out.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. “Are you quite
sure of that&mdash;quite sure you can be happy
without them, little girl?” father asked at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly sure, if I know I’m helping you
out, daddy.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;&mdash; But I can’t have your
mother worried, not any more than she is now
at least.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I won’t worry her!” Betty promised
eagerly. “It will just be a secret between
us two.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales smiled at her eagerness. “Not
a very agreeable secret, I’m afraid. Well,
then, Betty, if you insist, here it is. My business
has scarcely paid expenses for three
months, and a big investment I made in June
is going all wrong. By Christmas time I shall
probably know where I stand. Until then I
need every cent of ready money that I can get
hold of, and the more things you can be happy
without, the better. That’s all, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Th-thank you.” Betty felt as if she had
suddenly been plunged up to her neck in a
blinding fog that made all the old familiar
landmarks of life look queer and far away.
“It’s rather bad, isn’t it? But I’ll be very
economical, and I’ll think up ways of making
the others economical without their knowing
it. And you can have my emergency fund
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>this very night. That’s ready money. I
meant to give it to you before, but&mdash;&mdash;”
There was no use explaining that Nan had
said it was foolish to give the check back,
when she would need all of it and more so
soon for her fall wardrobe.</p>

<p>“Keep it and make it go as far as you can,”
father told her. “And don’t think too much
about these business troubles, or I shall be
sorry I confided in you.”</p>

<p>They were turning in at their own door.
“No, you won’t be sorry,” Betty assured him
proudly. “I won’t let you be sorry. Goodness!
I see one way to economize this very
minute. Mother’s got dozens of lights turned
on that she doesn’t need.” And she flitted
gaily ahead to begin her economy program.
But before she had reached the door, she
rushed back to whisper a last word in her
father’s ear.</p>

<p>“It’s mean not to tell mother too, daddy.
We could have so much more fun over it if we
all knew.”</p>

<p>“Fun over it!” repeated Mr. Wales slowly.
“Fun over it!” Then he reached out and
caught Betty in a big hug. “You’re the right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>sort, little girl. You stand up and face life
with a smile. Keep it up just as long as you
can, child.”</p>

<p>Betty considered, frowning in her earnestness.
“I’ve always had the smiling kind of
life so far, father, haven’t I? But I’ve wished
sometimes that I had to get things for myself,
like Helen Adams and Rachel and K. You
know I’ve told you about them, and about K.’s
brother who wants to go to college, and she’s
going to help. I shan’t mind a bit being
rather poor&mdash;till Christmas,” she added
prudently. “Now I’ll go and turn out the
lights and see that Dorothy is all right, and
you be telling mother.”</p>

<p>But father shook his head. “Not to-night,
anyway. You don’t realize the meaning of
all this yet, Betty. When you do, I’m afraid
it will look very different to you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t let it,” declared Betty eagerly.
“I said I’d help, and I will. Just try me.”</p>

<p>Betty went to bed with her pretty head in a
whirl. This was what they called being “out
in the wide, wide world.” “The real business
of life” that she had talked about so glibly with
the B’s and Roberta was going to begin at last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">BETTY WALES, “M. A.”</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Things</span> did look different in the morning.
Betty sighed a little as she considered her last
winter’s suit, which she had relegated to the
position of a rainy day stand-by, in the light
of a “general utility,”&mdash;K.’s delightful name
for her one street costume. K. and Rachel
had managed very well with a new suit once
in two or three years. Well, then, so could
she, Betty told herself sternly. Just then
Mary Hooper telephoned to know about the
Saturday rides.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t count on me,” Betty
explained to her. “No, I’m not too busy,
Mary, but riding horses are very expensive,
and I don’t believe I can afford it.”</p>

<p>Mary’s curt, “Oh, very well, I didn’t suppose
you had to consider that. Good-bye,
then,” stung a hot blush into Betty’s cheeks.
She didn’t care what Mary Hooper thought of
her&mdash;yes, she did&mdash;well, she wouldn’t any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>That night at dinner mother looked
worried, in her turn.</p>

<p>“My new cook has given notice,” she told
the assembled family the first time the
waitress went out of the room, “and I
thought she was going to be such a treasure!”</p>

<p>“What’s her trouble?” demanded Will gaily.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t like living where they keep
only two maids. Of course it is difficult to
manage, especially with such a big house.
Maggie is too busy sweeping and dusting and
answering the bell to help at all in the
kitchen. Yesterday the cook absolutely refused
to clean the silver, and to-night she
grumbled about wiping the dishes.”</p>

<p>“Then have the third maid back, Alice.
It was only to be an experiment, this cutting
down household expenses. I simply won’t
have you worried.” Father’s voice sounded
impatient, because he felt so very unhappy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I can help worrying
when everything goes wrong, and I understood
that it was absolutely necessary to cut
down expenses.” Mother’s voice sounded
stiff and unsympathetic, because father didn’t
realize how glad she had been to do her part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Then in a flash everything came out. “If
it wasn’t absolutely necessary to retrench
when we talked things over, it certainly is
now,” father began abruptly; “my New York
broker has disappeared. It seems he’s been
on the wrong side of the market lately, and
to help himself out he’s been borrowing the
securities that his customers had left on deposit
with him. That means that a good
many thousands of my money have gone,
with practically no hope of recovery. I’d
been holding that stock as a last reserve.
I’m afraid this spells ruin.” Father pushed
back his plate, and got up from the table.</p>

<p>“Please don’t go, father,” begged little
Dorothy solemnly, catching at his coat tails.
“Are we going to be really and truly poor?
Because if we aren’t going to have enough to
eat by and by, we ought not to waste to-night’s
dinner, that’s all cooked.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales laughed in spite of himself; and
then, because Maggie was coming back with
the salad, he sat down again, and somehow,
between silence and conversation about the
weather, dinner was finished.</p>

<p>Afterward Betty got Will and Dorothy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>down in the furthest corner of the lawn with
the gray kitten, so that mother and father, up
on the piazza, could talk things over and
come to an understanding.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Betty, are we going to be really
and truly poor?” little Dorothy demanded.
But when Betty kissed her and said no, not
really hungry and ragged, she was quite
ready to forget all about it and devote herself
to teaching the gray kitten to climb trees.
That left Will and Betty free to discuss the
family crisis.</p>

<p>“I shall take that job Cousin Joe West offered
me out at his shops,” Will declared.
“He’s awfully fussy, and father says he works
his men to death. That’s why I didn’t go
last June. Father thought he could certainly
get me something better by fall, but nothing
has turned up yet, and if I go with Joe that
will be one thing off father’s mind.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed. “It’s so easy to be poor if
you’re a boy. You’ll be earning your own
living&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose a fellow can live on what I’ll
earn, if he has to,” interrupted Will, making
a wry face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“And I shall have to spend father’s money
just as usual, only not so much of it. Oh,
dear, I wish I was bright enough to teach,
like Nan!”</p>

<p>“A penny saved is a penny earned,” quoted
Will sagely. “Nan will never save a penny,
that’s one thing sure. I say, didn’t we promise
the Benson girls that we’d be over to-night?”</p>

<p>When the Benson girls accused Betty of being
quiet and absent-minded she laughed at
them and asked if she generally monopolized
the entire conversation. But on the way
home she confided to Will that she hadn’t
heard a word Sallie Benson had said about
the plans for her coming-out cotillion. For
almost the first time in her life, except the
night after her famous runaway in senior
year, Betty did not fall asleep the minute her
head touched the pillow. She had promised
father to help and she meant to, as much as
ever she could. The hard question was how
to keep her word.</p>

<p>Next morning she put her plans into action.
After breakfast she hunted up Mrs. Wales,
who was in the sewing-room with a huge pile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>of mending on the table beside her. Betty
heroically helped herself to one of Will’s
stockings, and led up to her errand.</p>

<p>“When does the cook leave, mother?”</p>

<p>“This evening, I believe. She’s packing
now. I haven’t dared ask her what she
means to do about the breakfast dishes.”
Mother laughed happily. “We had such a
nice talk last night, your father and I. I feel
as if I were back in the days when we were
first married, and had to count all the pennies
we spent. After all, being poor isn’t so bad
as long as we have each other.”</p>

<p>Betty nodded sagely. She didn’t want
mother to find out that any one else had
been confided in first. “I knew you’d feel
so&mdash;I mean I think it’s a lot nicer to know the
worst. But are you going to get another cook?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales nodded. “I told your father
that we could get on beautifully with a general
maid, but he insists upon two. He
thinks we must keep up appearances as far
as possible, as a sort of business asset.”</p>

<p>“But a cook doesn’t appear,” Betty suggested.
“She’s behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, and that gives the second maid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>a chance to be in front of them. A good
many business acquaintances of your father’s
come through the city, and he wants to be
able to bring them up to dinner without
worrying about its being properly served.”</p>

<p>“It would have to be properly cooked too,
wouldn’t it?” Betty reflected solemnly.
“Well, anyhow, there’s no harm in telling
you what I want. I want to do the cooking.
I hate sweeping and dusting and mending,
and the things I mend are frights. But I
love to mess in the kitchen, and I’ve always
wanted a chance to do it without a fussy old
cook to glare at me and make remarks about
its being her kitchen, and a lot too full of
people. I don’t know how to make very
many things, except salads and chafing-dish
‘eats,’ but I’m wild to learn. Please let me,
mother. How much does a cook cost?”</p>

<p>“Eight dollars a week, unless she’s a particularly
good cook and gets ten,” laughed
Mrs. Wales. “But you’re absurd, Betty.
You don’t realize how much work it is to
cook for a big family like ours. Besides,
how would you manage when we had guests?
It would be very awkward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve thought that all out,” began
Betty eagerly. “I’d wait till the last minute
and then just turn things over to the waitress,&mdash;we’d
have to find a very accommodating
waitress, of course,&mdash;whisk off my laboratory
apron, and appear in the bosom of my family
arrayed in my best dress.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales shook her head. “That sounds
very simple, but I’m afraid it wouldn’t work.
You’d be red in the face from bending over
the fire, and your hands would be spoiled.
I’m sorry, dear,” as she noticed Betty’s expression
of disappointment, “but I’m afraid
you’ll have to think of some other more
practical ways of saving money.”</p>

<p>Betty stabbed viciously at the biggest hole
in her second stocking. “All right, mother,”
she said at last. “But please don’t say
no to my being cook just until you can
find one. You haven’t found one yet, have
you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales shook her head. “A friend of
Maggie’s is coming to see me this afternoon,
but I don’t imagine she’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t engage her unless she sounds perfectly
splendid,” urged Betty, folding up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Will’s stockings and tossing them on top of
the pile of finished mending.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she danced back, enveloped
in a long, checked gingham apron.
“The new cook, mem,” she announced,
curtseying gravely. “And the ould wan is
gone, mem, so wad yuz plaze be so kind as
to lave me have the ordhers for the dinner.”</p>

<p>Betty’s first dinner was a great success. It
was agreed not to tell father and Will who
cooked it; and when father praised the roast,
and Will loudly lamented the imminent departure
of a cook who could make such
“dandy” lemon ice, Betty blushed pink with
pride and pleasure. Next morning it was
only fun to get up early and dress in a
hurry. But the first relay of toast burned
up, and the eggs were done too hard, because
the coffee wouldn’t boil at all and then boiled
over. Will grumbled, father read his paper in
gloomy silence, and though mother tried to
smooth things over, she wore an “I-told-you-so”
expression, and Betty felt sure she
would be on hand to help with the next
breakfast.</p>

<p>But before that there was luncheon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Will, who was going out to see about his new
position, announced that he would come home
for it. Just as Betty was putting on her big
apron to begin operations, Mary Hooper rang
the bell. Betty discovered that Maggie had
said she was at home, so she slipped off the
big apron, and went down. Mary was chairman
of the play committee, and she wanted
to get Betty’s ideas about the cast and the costumes
before she called the rest of her committee
together.</p>

<p>“College girls are so clever at plays,” she
explained. “I thought you and I could save
a lot of time if we got everything decided beforehand.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t exactly Betty’s idea of good
committee work, but Mary hadn’t asked her
advice on that point, so they set to work. At
half-past twelve Mary discovered that it was
raining.</p>

<p>“How jolly!” she exclaimed. “That lets
me out of a tennis match with the Bensons
and Ted Farnum, and we can have the afternoon
clear for this.”</p>

<p>“Then will you excuse me for a few minutes,
Mary?” Betty asked anxiously. “Our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>cook has gone, and I’m taking her place. I
want to be sure that you’ll have some
luncheon.”</p>

<p>Mary lifted haughty eyebrows. “Can’t one
of the second maids see to that?” she asked,
getting up and going over to the window.
“Oh, well, if it’s going to put you out, I won’t
stay. Besides, it looks clearer already, so we
may play tennis after all. Oh, no, thank you,
I shouldn’t think of staying if you’re going
to make company of me, as they say in the
country. I remember at my aunt’s in New
Hampshire, they never could have any one
for Monday dinner, because it was wash-day.
Well, we’ve got a good deal done. I’ll drop
in at Milly’s, perhaps, on my way home, and
see what she thinks about our cast.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to find her apron, Betty
rushed to the kitchen, fully expecting to find
Mrs. Wales and Maggie there, and lunch well
under way,&mdash;which would have been rather a
disgrace to the young lady who had begged
to be allowed to act as cook, but on the whole
a comfortable arrangement. Instead, however,
the kitchen was deserted.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” soliloquized Betty sadly. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>wonder what mother meant to have. I remember
now that she went out. I wonder
what there is to have. Maggie might know&mdash;but
she probably wouldn’t. I’ll ask her,
though, if she’s down setting the table.”</p>

<p>Maggie was laying the table, but she had
no ideas on the subject of possible luncheon
dishes. So Betty found some eggs, got a chafing-dish
ready, and had all her preparations
made for a delicious omelette, when Will
came in, exasperated at Cousin Joe’s fussiness,
and very hungry, and reminded her that he
hated eggs.</p>

<p>“Oh, Will! I’m so sorry! Well, anyhow
you love strawberry jam.”</p>

<p>“Bread and jam aren’t specially filling,”
grumbled Will.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you begin on that?” suggested
Betty bravely. “And in the meantime I’ll
find you something else that is filling.”</p>

<p>“When are we going to have a cook, anyhow?”
demanded Will, when Betty had taken
her seat again, having instructed Maggie to
slice some cold roast beef.</p>

<p>“When are we going to have an experienced
cook, you mean, monsieur,” Betty corrected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
him gaily. In the pantry she had decided
that she should probably be cross herself
in Will’s place, and had therefore resolved
to take all his faultfinding in good part.
“Because at present you’ve got me, such as I
am. Suppose you give me a list of all your
favorite dishes, Will, and I’ll make them, if
they aren’t too hard. And just to relieve
your mind I’ll confide to you that mother is
hunting cooks this very morning.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Betty got a note from
Roberta Lewis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’m considering working for an M. A. at
Bryn Mawr,” she wrote. “Father is away all
day, and I don’t know enough people here in
Philadelphia to keep me from getting lonely.
Of course in some ways I should lots prefer
going to Harding, but father wouldn’t consent
to that. He wants me here whenever he is at
home. We’re getting to be regular chums.
We go to the theatre together, and he always
takes me for supper afterward, because he’s
heard that debutantes prefer theatre-suppers
to almost anything. He wanted to have Aunt
Nell come down from New York to help him
give a big party for me; but I made him see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>how absurd it would be for a staid old lawyer
like him and a quiet, stay-at-home, ’fraid-of-a-man
like me, to bother about big fussy parties.
So we just have nice little dinners for father’s
old friends, and next summer he is going to
teach me to ride horseback&mdash;I shudder whenever
I think of it!&mdash;and to play golf, so that
we can enjoy more things together. Write me
what you think about the M. A.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Roberta.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Betty scribbled her answer at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’m doing an M. A. myself, Roberta dearest.
It surprises you to hear that, doesn’t it?
Well, in my case M. A. stands for Mother’s
Assistant, and so far it’s the hardest course I
ever took. But if mother ever finds a good
cook&mdash;I’m the cook at present, and I should
love it if everything didn’t go wrong&mdash;why,
perhaps it will be easier. The other topics in
my M. A. are mending and dusting and housekeeping
odds and ends.</p>

<p>“If I am ever married and have any children,
I shall bring them up to eat whatever
there is on the table. Will hates eggs, and
loves apple-pie. Dorothy hates pie and adores
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>ice-cream. Father never eats ice-cream and
likes his steak rare. Mother wants her steak
actually burned, and nothing but crackers and
cheese and coffee for desert; and father loves
coffee, but mustn’t drink it. I am just as fussy
as any of them, but I never shall be again. I
must stop and get dinner. Pity the poor cook
of this hard-to-suit family!</p>

<p>“I think it would be grand to be able to
write M. A. after your name, but if you want
to really and truly learn something take my
kind.</p>

<span class="smaller">THAT TEA-ROOM AGAIN</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span>, arrayed in her cook’s regalia,
sat by the kitchen table, one eye on the range,
the other on the fly-leaf of the new cook-book
that Will had given her. It was scribbled full
of figures, which Betty added and subtracted
and multiplied laboriously, with sighs and incredulous
stares at the distinctly unpleasant
results.</p>

<p>“Three weeks’ hard work, and so far as I
can see I’ve saved the family exactly five dollars
and sixty-four cents. And that Vermont
maple sugar is boiling over again!” Betty
made a dive for the saucepan in which she
was cooking maple frosting for father’s birthday
cake. “If it tastes burned, what’s left of it,
I shall just give up!” she declared plaintively.</p>

<p>“Oh, Betty dear!” Dorothy’s shrill voice
and pattering footsteps sounded down the hall.
“You aren’t forgetting the kitten’s birthday,
are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Of course not,” Betty assured her, tasting
the frosting critically. “She’s to have oysters
and whipped cream. By and by you can whip
the cream, dearie, but it’s too soon now, and
I’m very busy, so you’d better run and find
mother.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m busy too. I’ve got to tie
on my kitten’s new neck-bow, and she wiggles
so that it’s awfully hard work. And then I’m
going to give her her box of corks that I
bought for her.”</p>

<p>Betty tasted the frosting again, decided that
it was done, put it away to cool, and went back
to her figures.</p>

<p>“Burned steak, two dollars,” she murmured;
“salty ice-cream, a dollar and twenty cents;
boiled-over coffee, thirty cents. I don’t believe
I’ve forgotten anything important that I
spoiled.” Then her smile flashed out suddenly.
“But real cooks spoil things&mdash;why,
of course they do! Not so many, maybe, but
some.” She began stirring the frosting vigorously.
“You always hear that figures lie. I
suppose the reason is because it’s so hard to
put down all about real cooks and other real
things in figures. Anyway, I’ve tried to help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>hard enough. After this I shall always be
sorry for cooks. I suppose there may be worse
ways of earning your living, but I shouldn’t
want to try them.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a letter for you, Betty!” The
smallest sister was back again, having evidently
intercepted the postman. “And the
kitten has got a post-card that says ‘Birthday
greetings.’ Isn’t it pretty? My chum at
school sent it to her.”</p>

<p>Betty declared hastily that the kitten’s
post-card was perfectly lovely, and asked
Dorothy to put her letter, with the address in
Madeline’s fascinating scrawling hand, and a
foreign stamp, into the table drawer; for the
cook’s fingers were sticky, the frosting obstinately
refused to thicken, and dinner-time
was approaching with alarming rapidity.</p>

<p>The day after Mary Hooper’s ill-timed call
Betty had delivered an ultimatum: “You’ve
either got to tend up to things or leave them
alone. Hereafter, when I’m busy in the
kitchen I can’t stop, no matter what happens.
Just tell people the truth, please.”</p>

<p>It was trying that the first thing to happen
should have been an invitation to go automobiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
by moonlight; and missing the second&mdash;an
impromptu tally-ho party, with a corn-roast
and a barn-dance to follow&mdash;would have
plunged Betty into the depths of woe if she
had not sternly resolved to “smile and smile
and go on cooking,” as Katherine had picturesquely
advised her, no matter what happened.
It was worth the cost too, when
father called her into the library to tell her,
in confidence, that he was proud of her, and
that she was setting Will a splendid example.</p>

<p>Will was finding Cousin Joe quite as trying
as he had been led to expect, and as he had
gone through life hitherto on the easy theory
that it is foolish to put yourself out much, because
the people who expect the most of you
are always cranks, nobody had thought that
he would stay long with Cousin Joe, who was
certainly an ideal instance of the theory. But
though he came home every evening tired
and discouraged, and grumbled a good deal
about Cousin Joe’s unfairness and silly notions,
he refused to give up his position.</p>

<p>“I’m no quitter. I can stick it out if the
girls can,” he announced doggedly, and on
his very first pay-day he bought Betty a cook-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
inscribed “With deep respect, from a
sympathetic fellow laborer,” which meant a
great deal from reserved, undemonstrative
Will.</p>

<p>Betty suspected that Will’s admiration was
at the bottom of her mother’s tacit consent to
her keeping on as cook. They had never discussed
the matter after the first interview, but
Mrs. Wales had gradually stopped visiting
agencies and looking up advertisements, and
Betty was beginning to feel that she was accepted
as “permanent.” And now some bad
fairy had put it into her head to see how
much she had saved father, and all she could
see was five dollars and sixty-four cents!</p>

<p>But that didn’t prevent the birthday dinner
from being a great success. Three weeks’
experience had wrought a wonderful change
in the new cook’s methods. Not only did she
“tend up” to the business in hand, herself,
but she could plan work for Maggie, and she
was no longer too proud to call on mother or
Dorothy for help if she needed it. So things
went smoothly, not by happy accident, as
things had always had a fashion of doing for
Betty Wales, but because she had planned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>them to go that way. The cream soup did
not curdle, the roast came on hot and done
just as mother liked it at one end and as
father liked it in the middle. The salad was
crisp and deliciously flavored. The pineapple
ice was not salty, and if the maple frosting
was a little inclined to drip off the edges of
the birthday cake, that was due, as Will
pompously explained, to “the extreme age of
the distinguished person whose semi-centennial
we celebrate, and to the consequent over-heating
of his cake by fifty burning candles.”</p>

<p>After dinner they went into the library to
taste a wonderful cereal coffee, which Betty
felt sure father would like just as well as the
real thing that he mustn’t drink.</p>

<p>“Let me see, Betty,” said Will sipping his
share reflectively. “This is the sixth near-coffee
that glib-tongued salesmen have palmed
off on you in three weeks.”</p>

<p>“It’s only the fifth,” returned Betty indignantly,
“and besides they were all free
samples.”</p>

<p>“In that case suppose you see if you can’t
discover some more brands before we settle on
one for family use,” suggested father gaily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Betty made a wry face as she emptied her
cup. “The trouble is the directions always
say ‘the whole secret of success is in the cooking,’
and ‘one trial is a gross injustice,’” she
quoted so solemnly that everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“Come and see the kitten eat her whipped
cream,” begged Dorothy. “She gets it all
over her little nose, and she hates to stop and
wash it off. Besides, I think she ought to
have more people than just Maggie and me at
her party.”</p>

<p>So Betty went out to the kitchen to swell
the numbers at the kitten’s party, and suddenly
remembering Madeline’s neglected letter
she slipped away to read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Well, I’m coming back to my own, my
native land,” Madeline wrote. “Father
thinks he wants to sub-let the apartment in
Washington Square. Of course he’ll jolly
well change his mind before I get to New
York, and then he’ll waste his substance
cabling me frantically not to sub-let. And
perhaps he and mother will come back too,
later on. But I don’t mind coming along by
myself. I’ve had enough of Italy and idleness.
My head is full of tales that I want to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>get out of my system and into the magazines.
I want to talk them over with Dick Blake.
He’s a frightful cynic, and he’ll be sure to tell
me that I can never make good. But he can’t
stop me that way, not till I’ve sat on editors’
door-steps for a while and seen for myself.</p>

<p>“Incidentally here I am in London buying
china madly for the tea-room&mdash;yours and
mine and Babbie’s, that we planned last summer.
The plans are so lovely that we’ve
simply got to carry them out. I ‘elect’ us to
do it. I’ve written Babbie to come and spend
October with me and help at one of my famous
house-cleanings. You must come too, and
then we can discuss it&mdash;the tea-room, I mean.
I should hate to hear my house-cleanings discussed.
And if we don’t have the tea-room,
the china will be adorable in the apartment.
It’s a blue Canton kind, and I’m getting
mostly double-decker bread-trays, and little
toast-racks, and mustard pots&mdash;such fascinating
squatty fat ones&mdash;and pepper grinders.
If you were here, we’d hunt up an English
cooking school and learn to make scones and
bannocks and Bath buns. I’ve asked a queer
little English woman in my boarding-house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>to give me the recipes. Perhaps you can
make them out. I can cook only by taste,
just as I can play only by ear; and the taste
of scones and bannocks is as complicated as
Wagner. I got your letter about being the
family cook. It will be valuable experience
for the tea-room.</p>

<p>“Come down early in October. Wire and
I’ll meet you any day after the fourth, when
my boat is supposed to come in. If either of
you could get there sooner, it would be terribly
jolly, because then you could meet me. The
key to the house is at the tailor’s underneath,
the cook left her new address on the mantle
in a pink cloisonné jar, and she’ll bring the
usual black cat for company while you wait.</p>

<p class="right2">“Yours en route,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Madeline</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Betty read it all through twice. It was so
delightfully haphazard and cheerful and
Bohemian. To-day was the twenty-sixth of
September. It would be such fun to go to
New York and share Madeline’s welcome
home to Bohemia. Babbie would go, of
course, and they would have famous parties to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>make use of the blue Canton mustard pots.
And if they should really open a tea-room!
For the first time since the launching of the
economy program Betty winked back some
real tears. Then she carefully turned out the
lights in the dining-room, which Maggie never
could remember about, and went back to the
library to read the family her letter, as she always
did when any of the Old Guard wrote
to her. As Will said, the penalty of writing
entertaining letters to Betty was that she felt
under obligation to celebrate your epistolary
ability by turning herself into a town-crier,
and crying your bon mots from the house-tops.</p>

<p>And the very next morning came a scrap of
a note from Babbie:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I’m going to spend October with Madeline.
Mother is off paying visits, so I can get away
easily. Be sure to come right away, because
we ought to get the tea-room started at once.
Mother says I may do just as I like about it,
only of course I know that I can’t stay away
from her all the time. When she says I can
do as I like she really means that I may have
all the money I want.</p>

<p>“Betty dear, if you really want to earn some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>money, why couldn’t you run the tea-room?
Madeline will be too busy with her writing.
Besides, she hates running things. I should
love it, only there’s mother to be amused.</p>

<p>“Babe is too wrapped up in her beloved
John to answer any letters. Bob is trying to
make her father start a newsboys’ home, and
he says perhaps he will if he can have his own
home back again. Bob has some little ragamuffin
or other up there all the time. I
prefer tea-rooms myself to newsboys’ homes or
fiancés.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Babbie.</span>”</p>

<p>“P. S. Jack and I have had a dreadful
quarrel. He was the one who came to see me
off, you know, and I never, never dreamed
we could change our minds. But all is over
between us. Please never mention his name
to me again.</p>

<p>“P. S. Do you think we should have the
tea-room in New York or Harding?”</p></div>

<p>This letter Betty read and reread, and
finally put away in her writing-desk without
so much as mentioning it to any one. But
that afternoon she went all by herself to have
afternoon tea at an attractive little shop that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>had just been opened down-town. She read
the menu carefully, and finally asked the
waitress if she might take it away with her.
She counted the tables, the waitresses, and the
patrons. She scanned the decorations with a
critical eye. She frowned when she noticed
that there were three different kinds of china
in the tea service that the maid had brought
her. Then she sat for a long while, sipping
her tea and trying to remember little details
of the fascinating Glasgow tea-rooms, and of
the Oxford Street and Piccadilly shops that
the B. A.’s abroad had haunted so persistently
in the pursuit of Madeline’s “dominant interest.”
Finally she tried to compare the
prices on the cards with those at Cuyler’s and
Holmes’s in Harding. And last of all, she extracted
a tiny silver pencil from her shopping-bag,
and put down a few figures on the back
of the menu. But she soon gave up that.
Hadn’t she just discovered that figures lie?
And besides, when you can’t even guess at
rents, and haven’t the least idea how much
chairs and tables and china cost, and are even
a little uncertain about waitress’s wages, the
calculating of the probable expenses per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>month of running a tea-room becomes, to say
the least, a difficult matter.</p>

<p>At last, having remembered her responsibilities
about dinner, Betty rushed home and
into her big apron&mdash;she had half a dozen big
ones now&mdash;as fast as possible. She was very
quiet during dinner, but afterward, as soon
as she had helped Maggie clear the table, she
put out the lights, walked into the library,
and made an astonishing announcement.</p>

<p>“Father dear, if you’re willing and mother
can get another cook and you won’t all miss
me too much, I want to go to New York next
week to see about running a tea-room for
Babbie Hildreth. We haven’t decided yet
whether to have it there or in Harding, but
Babbie thinks I could run it, and I think so
too.”</p>

<p>“Why, Betty, don’t be absurd!”</p>

<p>That was mother’s comment. Will
whistled; Dorothy, scenting the loss of her
beloved Betty, came over to hug her; but
father threw away his cigar, folded his paper
slowly, and pointed to the arm of his chair as
the best available seat.</p>

<p>“Now begin again,” he advised, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>Betty had established herself comfortably.
“Your proposition does sound absurd, as
mother says, but perhaps that’s because we
don’t understand it. To begin with, has Miss
Babbie Hildreth already gone into the tea-room
business? I understood from Miss
Bohemia’s letter of yesterday, that so far the
sole assets of the tea-room were some double-decker
bread-trays, whatever those may be,
and some very fat mustard jars, which hadn’t
yet left London, and which Miss Bohemia
really wanted for her own use.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, that was just Madeline’s queer
way of saying it. She’s written to Babbie,
and Babbie has asked her mother for the
money, and her mother is willing. So now
Babbie has written me. Of course there are a
lot of things still to be arranged,” Betty admitted
reluctantly, “but it won’t take Babbie
and Madeline long to arrange them.”</p>

<p>“I see.” This time Mr. Wales was quite
serious. “And you think that under the
circumstances&mdash;my circumstances, I mean&mdash;you
would like to join in their project. I’m
afraid I can’t spare you any capital, little
girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want you to,” explained
Betty hastily. “The others don’t expect it.
But I’ve thought it over and&mdash;isn’t it likely
to be a long while before business is good
again, father?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will be fully a year before
I’m on my feet again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to help, to be really and
truly earning something, I mean, like Nan
and Will. I should perfectly hate to teach,
but I should love to run a tea-room.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the idea of my daughter’s
going into the restaurant business,” put in
Mrs. Wales stiffly.</p>

<p>“Oh, mummy dear!” Betty abandoned
her father’s chair for a seat beside her mother
on the sofa. “An adorable little tea-room
isn’t a restaurant. College girls are always
running tea-rooms. Why, Mary Hooper has
a friend in Boston who does it, and Mary is
always telling about her, for all she’s such a
snob.”</p>

<p>“Would you have to sit at a desk near the
door and see that everybody paid up before he
could get out?” demanded Will, very scornfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>Betty considered. “Why, I don’t know.
I might. But if Madeline plans things she’ll
have a desk that the Queen of England would
be dying to sit at, if she saw it,” she ended
gaily.</p>

<p>“But are you sure of making money?” demanded
father dryly. “Times are bad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But even in bad times people have to eat,”
Betty took him up hastily. “And if tea is
sixty cents a pound, and there are piles of
cups in that, and you sell a cup for ten cents,
how can you help making money? People
do, in tea-rooms, or they wouldn’t be sprouting
up everywhere. And if it can be done
I’m sure Madeline and Babbie and I can do
it. I just know we can!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales’s glance traveled from Betty’s
dancing eyes to her mouth with its pleading
curves. “Well, mother,” he said, “shall we
let her try?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wales hesitated. “I don’t like the idea
at all, but under the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk it over and let you know in the
morning,” father suggested.</p>

<p>“Betty,” began little Dorothy forlornly,
“you said I could be ’sistant cook as soon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>I learned to toast the bread and not burn it.
And now I’ve learned. If you go away and
have a tea-room, I think I ought to be something
in that.”</p>

<p>“You can be a silent partner, mademoiselle,”
suggested Will teasingly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Dorothy.</p>

<p>“About the same thing as a company, I
guess,” explained Will. “Betty can call herself
Betty Wales &amp; Co., and you can be the
Co. See?”</p>

<p>“Of course I see,” declared Dorothy with
great dignity. “And I think I’d rather be a
Co. than a ’sistant cook. Don’t forget that
I’m the Co., Betty.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Betty promised laughingly. But
she gave “Co.” a hug that made the little girl
gasp for breath. The tea-room might be mere
fun for Madeline and Babbie, and father and
mother might look upon it as a foolish fad;
but to Betty it was solemn earnest, and the
unqualified interest and approval of even one
little girl, who didn’t understand, helped.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">PLANS AND PARTIES</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Mr. Wales called Betty into
the library to tell her she might do as she
liked about the tea-room. His voice broke as
he explained that unless things took a sudden
turn for the better they should probably have
to give up their house, at least for a year or so.</p>

<p>“So your present position is likely to be
abolished,” he went on with a rather forlorn
attempt at gaiety, “and I heartily sympathize
with your wish to be up and doing. I hate
to think that a daughter of mine needs to
work, but I’m glad she isn’t afraid to. It
used to be the fashion for young ladies whose
families had lost their money to sit at home,
turning and mending their clothes and remembering
better days.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;like Mary Hooper’s great-aunts,”
laughed Betty. “That’s so stupid. I’m glad
I was born later. But, father, did mother
come around to the restaurant idea? Because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>maybe Nan or Rachel or somebody could get
me a place to teach, if mother would be happier
about it. But girls who want to work
don’t all teach nowadays. Truly they don’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales laughed. “That’s another antiquated
notion, is it&mdash;that teaching is the only
‘genteel’ calling? Your mother and I about
came to that conclusion last night. Anyway
we’re quite willing that you should try out
this project. I will give you the money that
your board here would cost for the rest of the
winter. You can use it as capital if you like,
but I should strongly advise holding it as an
emergency fund for personal expenses. Tea
may be sixty cents a pound and ten cents a
cup, but I imagine you’ll find that’s only one
very small detail in the budget of a tea-room.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Betty, not daring to
avow complete ignorance of the meaning of
a budget. “And thank you ever so much,
father, for letting me try. If we don’t succeed
and my emergency fund gives out, will
you send me some beautiful references as a
cook?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, after you’ve basely deserted
us with less than a week’s notice,” retorted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>her father, pulling a yellow curl, and Betty
danced off, perfectly delighted at the exciting
prospects before her, to look over her clothes
and make a list of other things she should
need “in her business.” But her ideas of the
duties of her position were so vague and businesslike,
and clothes so very uninteresting,
that she finally decided not to waste her last
week at home over them. If Madeline
thought her shirt-waists looked too frivolous,
she could overwhelm her with the six big
aprons and Will’s cook-book.</p>

<p>Betty timed her arrival in New York a day
after Madeline’s, but only Babbie Hildreth
met her train.</p>

<p>“Madeline’s stuck in the fog down the harbor,”
she explained. “So when I came last
night I got the key from the tailor and hunted
up the cook, all by myself, and she brought
the cat just as Madeline said she would. And
then that nice Mrs. Bob, the one we met before,
helped me give a party.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to be giving a
party?” laughed Betty.</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Bob was tired of her own
apartment. It’s perfectly gorgeous, you know,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>since they got all that money, but she says
it’s so elegant and well-kept that it spoils the
informality of things. So the cook swept,
and we dusted, and Mr. Bob invited the people
and bought the food. It was great.”
Babbie gave a comical little skip to emphasize
her complete satisfaction with life. Then
suddenly her small face took on its most serious
expression. “And to think how miserable
I’ve been lately. Poor mother was glad
enough to let me come down here, I’m afraid,
I was so cross. I’m never going to look at a
young man again, Betty Wales, as long as I
live. So there now!”</p>

<p>Betty patted Babbie’s arm soothingly.
“That won’t prevent their looking at you,
I’m afraid,” she suggested, “at least not unless
you stop buying such becoming hats.”</p>

<p>Babbie frowned. “One can’t turn oneself
into a frump, just on their account. Buying
becoming hats is one of the chief consolations
of life. I didn’t mean that I was going to retire
from the world, but I shall never let any
one fall in love with me, never. That’s settled!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Betty. “Now let’s
settle where we’re going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“That’s settled too,” explained Babbie.
“Mr. Dick Blake is meeting Madeline, because
I had to meet you. Then we are all to
meet each other for a grand lunch party, to
celebrate Mr. Blake’s getting into his scrumptious
new offices,&mdash;the ones that your Mr.
Morton arranged for, you know. And to-night
Mrs. Bob is going to take us all for dinner
to a new East Side place that they’ve discovered.”
Babbie stopped to survey Betty
critically. “You don’t mind wasting to-day,
do you, and beginning on tea-rooms the first
thing to-morrow? Your letter sounded as
solemncholy as Helen Chase Adams when
she was a freshman.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “How dreadful! Of course
I don’t mind. But you see, Babbie, this tea-room
business is just fun for you, but for me
it’s dead in earnest. If we can’t make it pay
pretty well, why, next year I may have to teach.”</p>

<p>Babbie nodded vigorously. “I see. That’s
a prospect to make a person solemn, isn’t it?
But by next year your father will probably
be rich again. And I don’t want you to think
I’m not in earnest too, Betty. I’m going into
this thing head over heels, just to show a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
person that he doesn’t make one least
little speck of difference to me.” Babbie’s
big eyes flashed dangerously. “So to-morrow
we’ll pursue tea-rooms like anything.”</p>

<p>But ten o’clock the next morning found
the three pursuers of tea-rooms gathered
rather languidly around Madeline’s dainty
breakfast table. Mrs. Bob’s party had been,
as usual, a continuous performance, beginning
at a very foreign café in Little Italy, going on,
because the Italian dessert had proved disappointing,
to a glittering hotel on Fifth Avenue,
thence back to a Yiddish theatre, whose
leading lady was Mr. Bob’s latest enthusiasm,
and winding up, very late indeed, at supper
near the park, after which it took so long to
get home that Mrs. Bob declared she was
hungry again and made everybody come up
to the apartment for more supper.</p>

<p>“If everybody in New York eats as often as
we did last night, there ought to be a good
chance for tea-rooms,” said Babbie, sipping her
coffee meditatively.</p>

<p>“If it makes them feel so sleepy the next
day, they won’t do it very often,” suggested
Betty prudently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, they will, but they’ll order breakfast
at eleven instead of at ten,” amended Madeline.
“Well, now,” she went on briskly, “how are
we going to work? Having decided to start
a tea-room, what does a person do next?”</p>

<p>“We have absolutely decided, haven’t we?”
asked Betty, to make sure.</p>

<p>“Of course.” Madeline waved a hand at the
huge box of china that an expressman had
just delivered. “Coming over in the cab
yesterday, Dick read the story I wrote on shipboard&mdash;the
one I thought was going to make
me a name instanter&mdash;and he says it’s amateurish.
That’s the most hateful adjective in the
language of Bohemia, and I’ll make him eat
his words. But meanwhile I’ve got to eat
something more sustaining than words, and
I’ve spent all the money I had to live on
this quarter. So I’ve got to get rid of that
china. So we’ve got to take it for a tea-room.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“If you think this tea-room is being started
to confirm you in your extravagant habits,
Madeline Ayres&mdash;&mdash;” began Babbie, in mock
indignation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="400" alt="“HOW ARE WE GOING TO WORK?”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“HOW ARE WE GOING TO WORK?”</p>

<p class="p2">“Well, the point is that we’ve decided to
start it,” pursued Madeline calmly, “and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>might add that the china designated as my
latest extravagance is likely to be its chief
charm, if not exactly its reason for being.
Now I should say the next question is where
to have it. And as it’s such a glorious day,
let’s go out and explore.”</p>

<p>The exploring expedition, being conducted
by Madeline in true Bohemian style, bid fair
to degenerate into a progressive course luncheon,
leading from one of her favorite tea-shops
to the next.</p>

<p>“But it’s very instructive,” she declared in
answer to Babbie’s protests. “I’ve made a
beautiful collection of menu cards for us to
consider to-night. I’ll get Bob Enderby to do
us a design that will make a regular hit by itself.
What’s that, Betty? Of course a menu
design isn’t the principal thing. But it will
be a beautiful feature, like the china. Well,
this is the sixth cup of tea I’ve had, so I don’t
mind stopping now. If you girls don’t like
my methods, suggest something else. I think
we’ve had a most entertaining morning, and
garnered in loads of valuable ideas.”</p>

<p>“Well, but what have we actually decided?”
demanded Betty, the matter-of-fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Madeline told off the points solemnly on
her fingers. “To have waitresses with soulful
eyes and, if possible, adorable French accents.
To remember that it is the special
features that people tell their friends to go
and see, but the food must be passable too, or
they’ll never come twice. To have immaculate
linen, and china that matches. To provide
dusky corners for romantic couples.”</p>

<p>Babbie sniffed. “I hate romantic couples!”</p>

<p>“They order recklessly,” Madeline argued.
“Therefore, for mercenary considerations, they
must be encouraged.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t those things we would have
done anyway?” pursued Betty. “I think
we ought to find a place and get started, and
then look out for the features.”</p>

<p>Madeline considered. “That sounds sensible.
Well, then, let’s discuss sites.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a good plan to know something
definite about rents?” suggested Betty,
who foresaw that Madeline’s next move would
be a leisurely promenade up Fifth Avenue,
which would be very pleasant but productive
of no tangible results.</p>

<p>“Rents&mdash;of course. I’ll tell you what!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>Madeline had had another inspiration. “I
know a man who is in real estate&mdash;the one we
rent our place from. I’ll call him up and ask
him if he’s too busy to enlighten us this very
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Madeline came back from the telephone in
high spirits. “He will be dee-lighted to see
us. Oh, dee-lighted is out of fashion, isn’t it,
since I went away? Well, proud and happy
then. Come along. It’s only a little way
from here, and we can do up the whole thing
before dinner.”</p>

<p>But “the whole thing” proved much more
complicated than Madeline had supposed.
The agent treated them in a businesslike way,
which was really very nice of him, Babbie
said afterward, considering their vague and
even childlike ideas on the subject of what
they wanted. He had half a dozen suites on
his books that seemed to Madeline suitable,
and she went over them easily, suggesting
their respective advantages to the other two
girls, who were less familiar than she with the
ins and outs of New York life.</p>

<p>“This is really the best, I think,” she decided
at last, pointing to a Fifth Avenue address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a rather expensive location,” suggested
the agent politely. “But perhaps
that’s no object”&mdash;with a glance at Babbie’s
exquisite little figure.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is,” Betty assured him solemnly.
“You see we want to make a lot of
money. How much is the rent, please?”</p>

<p>The agent’s figures fairly took the girls’
breath away. “And I believe they prefer a
seven years’ lease,” he added.</p>

<p>“Seven years!” repeated Babbie incredulously.
“Why, we shall all be mar&mdash;dead in
seven years, probably. A month’s rent at
that rate would take up about what I think
mother meant to give me. But then she’ll
have to give me more. Which is the very
cheapest place, please?”</p>

<p>The agent pointed it out, but it was only
cheap by comparison. And then, as if matters
were not bad enough already, he made a
disheartening suggestion. “You ought to
have at least capital enough to keep you going
for a year,” he said. “You couldn’t hope
to make much the first year, you know.
That’s usually reckoned a dead loss, in conservative
business estimates, I believe.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>
<p>The girls exchanged glances of consternation.</p>

<p>“We’re very much obliged,” said Babbie,
with a fine combination of dignity and her
sweetest smile. “But I’m afraid we can’t decide
on anything to-day. We may be
back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” the agent cut her short.
“Always very glad to be of service. Good-day.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want us to come back,” Babbie
declared hotly, outside the door. “He’s
afraid we wouldn’t pay the rent on time.”</p>

<p>“We probably shouldn’t, any such rents as
those,” Madeline assured her. “We acted
like babes in the wood, I suppose. Never
mind. We’ll ask Bob Enderby and Dick.
They’ll know what to do. You were jolly
right, Betty, about beginning on the essentials.”</p>

<p>That night Mrs. Bob’s sitting-room was the
scene of a solemn council of war. Dick
Blake was scribe, Henri, the Enderbys’ cook,
who had once conducted what Dick irreverently
described as the slowest quick lunch
place in town, was called in as an expert,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>along with the girl in the top flat, because
her two cousins had had a tea-room, until one
of them discovered that drawing caricatures
of the customers paid much better than selling
them sandwiches and tea.</p>

<p>“But it was a splendid thing&mdash;that tea-room,”
explained the girl earnestly, “because
Arline never knew she could draw until then.
She sat at the desk, you see, and took checks,
and there wasn’t much she could do, so she
got to sketching and thought it was fun, and
went into an evening class, and now she’s got
two things in the big autumn exhibit.”</p>

<p>“Listen to that,” cried Mr. Bob with enthusiasm.
“Which of you is going to sit at
the desk?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am,” confessed Betty, “and I
haven’t the least talent for drawing, so there
won’t be any great artist discovered in our
tea-room.”</p>

<p>“Well, my other cousin got married
through the tea-room,” explained the girl
from the top flat, naively. “They sold candy
there, and she married the man they bought
their candy boxes of. He’s a millionaire.”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried Mr. Bob. “Now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>which of you is going to get the millionaire?”</p>

<p>“Come, Bob, do be serious,” begged Madeline.
“We want to get at the facts.”</p>

<p>“A millionaire is a very valuable fact,” objected
Mr. Bob flippantly. “That’s all,
Henri, except that we shall want an extra
fine supper by and by. Now, Miss Andrus,
tell us some more about the profits of tea-rooms,
the legitimate ones, if Madeline insists
upon it.”</p>

<p>But Miss Andrus was vague about “legitimate”
profits. She only knew that her cousin
had had a darling shop, and had hated to give
it up. Then she went over to the piano and
played dreamy music, while Richard Blake
and Mrs. Bob and the girls struggled with
their estimates.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Madeline’s brow
puckered. “It’s going to be too big for us to
swing, I think. Mrs. Hildreth might give
you all that money, Babbie, but I don’t think
we ought to take it.” She swept the papers
together. “Enjoy our society while you have
it, ladies and gentlemen. To-morrow we’re
going up to Harding to open a tea-room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“But, Madeline,” began Betty, “are you
sure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure of anything except that rents
are lower there, because it would be absurd if
they weren’t, and that those college girls eat
and eat, and they appreciate stunty features
beyond anything. Now Cuyler’s isn’t stunty
and Holmes’s isn’t stunty. With that china
and the menu card that Bob is going to do for
us&mdash;I forgot to ask you before, Bob, but of
course you will&mdash;and all the other features
that we can easily think up, why, at Harding
our fortune is made. I can’t see how we ever
hesitated!”</p>

<p>“But if you go up there we can’t patronize
you,” objected Mrs. Bob forlornly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can,” Madeline assured her
promptly, “you can motor up. And Dick
can see that your escapade gets into the society
columns of all the leading dailies. In a
month it will be the fashion to motor up from
New York for a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>“Madeline,” said Dick severely, “you’re
a persuasive sophist. Who holds the controlling
interest in this tea-room, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Babbie, I suppose,” admitted Madeline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>cheerfully. “Because she furnishes all the
money&mdash;or all that’s worth mentioning, at
least. But Betty furnishes the sense, and I
furnish the inspirations. Now what’s the
matter with that combination?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you about through with your business?”
demanded Mr. Bob irrelevantly, from
his place by the piano. “Because Miss Andrus
is hungry, and I’m starved.”</p>

<p>Betty partook of Henri’s famous club sandwiches
and Turkish coffee in forlorn silence.
She ought not to have come. She ought to
have realized that Madeline’s haphazard methods
were splendid for getting up college
“shows,” but not to be relied on when one’s
bread and butter had to be earned. Madeline
was in a corner by the fire talking earnestly
with Mrs. Bob, who was saying something
that made Madeline hug her and presently
rush over to Betty and Babbie to explain.</p>

<p>“The lovely Mrs. Bob wants to invest in
our tea-room,” she told them. “You say
your mother spoke of four hundred, Babbie.
Well, Mrs. Bob says she’ll put in the same,
and after Betty’s salary is paid and the
other expenses, the profits are to be divided&mdash;that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
what you said was right, isn’t it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“But half my profits go to Madeline,” Mrs.
Bob took her up, “for the inspirations.”</p>

<p>“Then I know mother will want half hers
to go that way, too,” put in Babbie, “and I
shall take the other half, to pay her up for
being pessimistic about profits. She just
laughed when I spoke of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be all kinds of fun, anyway,”
said Madeline. “Goodness, but I feel as if
the worst was over now! Does any one
know about early trains up to Harding? By
the way, father hasn’t cabled, so I suppose
this domicile is to let. Just spread the report,
please, everybody, and I’ll come back in
a few days to see about it. It’s just as well,
because I suppose I’ve got to live in Harding
now. I never could manage long-distance inspirations.”</p>

<p>The three girls departed early to pack and
telegraph Mary Brooks Hinsdale that her
“standing invitation” to come and visit her
should stand no longer unheeded by her little
friends of old.</p>

<p>So perhaps it hadn’t been a wasted day after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>all, Betty thought, falling asleep while Madeline
was still busily discussing where they
should live in Harding, and how much they
ought to pay the tea-shop for their meals, if
they ate them there.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE REAL THING</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary’s</span> “beamish” smile was dimmed
when she met her guests at the station.</p>

<p>“I’m just terribly glad to see you all,” she
explained, “and to-morrow we can begin to
have some fun. But to-night I have an awfully
particular faculty dinner-party on, and what
do you think? My cook has gone and caught
the jaundice.” Mary’s tone was positively
tragic.</p>

<p>“This is what you get for marrying a distinguished
member of the faculty,” Madeline
told her, patting her shoulder sympathetically.
“But don’t you give that very particular dinner-party
another thought, my child. What’s
the point of having a full-sized catering company
invade your happy little home if you
don’t make use of them?”</p>

<p>“A catering company?” Mary stared.
“There isn’t such a thing in Harding.”</p>

<p>“Well, a tea-shop corporation then,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>Madeline amended briskly. “We are that,
you know. We’ve come up here to establish
ourselves. Meanwhile we are not above displaying
our talents for the benefit of our very
best friends. Betty says she can cook, and
Babbie and I are bursting with ideas for
original menus and beautiful table decorations.
Have you a waitress?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she’s very green and needs piles
of coaching. Betty, please explain a few of
Madeline’s riddles.”</p>

<p>“Come up to Cuyler’s first,” suggested Babbie.
“It’s such a very long story.”</p>

<p>So the story was told, in all its ramifications,
over many cups of Cuyler’s hot chocolate, and
Mary went into ecstasies over the idea of a
tea-shop in Harding, and into more ecstasies
over the prospect of having Betty, and probably
Madeline, so near her. Then she returned
to the subject of her dinner.</p>

<p>“Would you really cook it, Betty?”</p>

<p>“Would you really trust her to cook it?”
jeered Madeline.</p>

<p>“Yes, because there’s absolutely nothing
else to be done,” said Mary, so dismally that
everybody else shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Very well then,” agreed Madeline. “You
and Betty go and do your marketing, and
Babbie and I will examine tea-room sites.
We ought not to lose any time, you know,”
she added impressively, with a sly glance at
Betty.</p>

<p>“Don’t decide everything without me,”
begged Betty innocently.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Madeline promised, with a
very solemn, responsible air. “Come on,
Babbie. Oh, I say, is that Polly Eastman
going into the bookstore?”</p>

<p>“Not at all likely,” laughed Babbie, rushing off.
“I never knew Polly to buy a book.”</p>

<p>The pursuit of Polly ended all serious business
for that morning. It transpired that she
had just been elected a member of the senior
play committee, and she had resolved to buy a
set of Shakespeare in honor of the occasion.
First Babbie and Madeline must help her
choose the books, then they must explain
themselves, and as that was “such a long
story,” they all retired to Holmes’s to talk it
over and have ices. Then Polly had to hurry
back for a noon recitation, and it would be a
shame not to rush up to the campus with her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>and say hello to Georgia Ames. And Georgia,
who also had a twelve o’clock class, begged
them, with tears in her big brown eyes, to
hang around till one, and then have “eats”
with her down-town. So Madeline wrote a
note to Mary, who would be relieved not to
have so many people to lunch, and bribed a
freshman friend of Georgia’s to deliver it on
her way home. And she and Babbie sat on
the steps of College Hall in the warm October
sunshine, surrounded by a crowd of friends,
old and new, to all of whom Madeline confided,
under the strictest pledges of secrecy
and with much delightful mystery as to
where and when and by whom, the fact that a
new and particularly “stunty” tea-shop was
to be started right away in Harding.</p>

<p>“I should make my fortune as an advance
advertising agent,” she told Babbie complacently,
as they hurried up to Mary’s after
lunch. “Getting everybody properly excited
is awfully important, but I’m afraid Betty
won’t appreciate that, and will think we
ought to have found a place. Did you happen
to notice any that would do?”</p>

<p>Babbie considered. “Why, any place down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>on Main Street would do well enough, I should
think, but they’re all full, aren’t they? I
don’t suppose any store would move out to
let us in.”</p>

<p>“There must have been some vacant places
that we didn’t notice,” said Madeline cheerfully.
“We’ll just tell Betty that we think
she ought to choose, as long as she’s going to
run it. That will throw the responsibility on
her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it will find us a place,
though,” said Babbie gloomily. “And we’ve
forgotten the water-color paper for Mary’s
place-cards.”</p>

<p>Mary embraced her guests almost tearfully
when, the dinner-party having taken its staid
departure, the cook and her assistants returned
to the “realms of day,” as Madeline
poetically designated the library.</p>

<p>“I had awful times explaining,” Mary told
them. “They pricked up their ears at the
place-cards. The soup got them seriously interested,
and the salad positively went to their
heads. I muttered something about a new
cook, and I could see every woman at the
table privately resolving to get her away from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>me forthwith.” Mary chuckled. “When
you get ready to establish a catering branch,
I’ll write you a screaming advertisement like
this:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">“<i>Remember Mrs. Hinsdale’s Dinner and how<br />
Envious it made you<br />
And Patronize her Caterers, Betty Wales &amp; Co</i>.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled and then sighed. “We can’t
establish branches until we’ve started, can we?
And we can’t seem&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Reproach us not, fair maiden,” Madeline
broke in. “You are hereby elected committee
on rooms, isn’t she, Babbie? You go
ahead and choose, and we’ll agree to anything
you decide.”</p>

<p>Next morning the committee on rooms announced
her plan for a systematic campaign.
“I wish you two would come and help look,
but if you do, remember that we can’t stop to
talk with Georgia or any one else we meet,
and we can’t do any shopping or eating until
after half-past twelve.”</p>

<p>But a brisk walk the whole length of Main
Street only served to confirm Madeline’s and
Babbie’s fears. Every building was occupied.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in somewhere and ask what to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>do when you want to start something,” Betty
decided, bound not to lose faith in systematic
procedure. “You do the talking, Madeline.”</p>

<p>“Why, you might persuade some property
owner to build for you,” suggested the jeweler’s
clerk, whom Madeline rushed in upon
with her question.</p>

<p>“Thanks, but we want to move in about
day after to-morrow,” Madeline told him
grandly.</p>

<p>“Well, I presume you’ve all heard the old
saying, ‘If wishes were horses every Harding
girl would ride,’” retorted the clerk with a
grin and a wink.</p>

<p>“Horrid thing!” said Babbie, when they
were outside. “He thinks we’re college girls
off on some kind of a queer lark. We’ll show
him! Where next, Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty was staring up the hill with an air of
profound discouragement. “I think we
ought to look at the side-streets,” she decided
at last. “I don’t believe it’s any use considering
up-stairs rooms.”</p>

<p>“I feel like the senior play committee,”
said Madeline, as they began their conscientious
tour, hoping against hope that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>should find just the right thing lurking around
some corner off Main Street. “We read all
the impossible Elizabethan dramas that anybody
could hear of, we hunted up Hindu
plays, and made frantic efforts to hunt up
Japanese ones; and some particularly earnest
member even wrote a play herself. And all
the time we knew as well as anything that
Billy Shakespeare was our man.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the way you feel about this,
where, please, is our Billy Shakespeare?” inquired
Babbie a trifle irritably.</p>

<p>Madeline smiled mysteriously. “We shall
find him before the set of sun,” she declared
oracularly. “I have a leading to that effect.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you make it before high noon,
just as well?” sighed Babbie. “I’ve got on
new shoes.”</p>

<p>Betty looked troubled. “Go home and
rest, Babbie dear,” she begged. “Two of us
can do this just as well as three.”</p>

<p>So Babbie went off, after a few polite protests,
and Madeline and Betty finished up the
cross-streets without seeing anything that
could possibly be turned into a “stunty” tea-room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<p>“Well, can there be anything up nearer the
college that we haven’t noticed?” asked
Betty, trying to keep up the businesslike air
appropriate to systematic research, but feeling
very silly and completely discouraged.</p>

<p>“All boarding-houses, isn’t it, right down
to the theatre?” said Madeline.</p>

<p>“Shall we go and look?” suggested Betty
timidly. “I can’t quite remember what’s between
the florist’s and that little white house
that a crowd of juniors had last year.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” returned Madeline promptly, as
they started up the hill. “Don’t you know&mdash;there’s
a wide lawn, and you go back across
it to that big barn that the riding man had
for his horses? He’s moving out, by the way.
I met him yesterday, and he assured me that
’e missed them queer moon-lighters most
hawfully. He’s going to move somewhere
where he can have a big ring and some
hurdles in a meadow. I’m afraid I rather
led him to suppose”&mdash;Madeline looked properly
conscience-stricken&mdash;“that we might be
up this afternoon to have a lesson in jumping.
But it looks as if we should be too busy.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there’s any use hunting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>much longer?” demanded Betty, who was fast
losing courage.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Madeline shot back unhesitatingly.
“Something will turn up; it always
does&mdash;if you turn it. Let’s make perfectly
sure about this nearer-the-campus proposition.”</p>

<p>But there was nothing there, and Madeline,
not daring to suggest refreshing themselves at
Cuyler’s, after Betty’s strict prohibitions, led
the way up the high terrace to the back steps
of Science Hall, where they could rest and
consider what to do next. Right across from
them was the little white house with the big
barn looming up behind it.</p>

<p>“What a shame that isn’t a house,” said
Betty sadly. “How did such a tiny house
ever happen to have such a big barn, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t,” explained Madeline. “The
barn went with the house over on that other
street&mdash;the one that used to be a big mansion&mdash;and
now is only part of a factory. But if
the barn were a house, Miss Wales, the riding-master
wouldn’t be moving out of it. It
would have been appropriated long ago by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>some thrifty boarding-house keeper, and we
shouldn’t be sitting here staring at it and
wondering whether the owner could be persuaded
to make it over into a house in
hurry-up order.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t wondering that,” said Betty
simply. “I was wondering if we could possibly
use it as it is. There’s nothing else that
I can see, and it’s an awfully nice barn. Don’t
you remember how Mr. Ware showed us
through once when he first moved in, and how
proud he was that it was all paneled in solid
oak, with those lovely great beams in the
ceiling? And afterward the pickle heiress’s
father wanted to buy the beams for his
library, and he would have, too, only the
owner was in Europe and the pickle man
couldn’t wait to cable.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” agreed Madeline. “It’s
a beautiful barn, but it’s a barn nevertheless,
with stalls and mangers and grain-bins
and&mdash;&mdash;” Madeline paused abruptly and
stared across at the barn through half-shut
eyes for a long minute. “Why, of course it
will do,” she announced briskly. “Of all the
idiots&mdash;to sit here gaping! Come on!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>And grasping Betty’s arm, she dragged her in
a headlong race down the terrace, across the
road, and up the drive to the big barn.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad it’s open,” she exclaimed
breathlessly. “Now I can show you. I see it
all myself plain as anything. Long narrow
tables in the stalls&mdash;ideal nooks for romantic
couples. Big sociable round tables out here.
Ferns and oak branches in the mangers.
Bins transformed into linen and china cupboards.
Old sporting prints on the walls&mdash;father
has some beauties tucked away somewhere.
Gargoyles and candlesticks and
Flemish lamps scattered around in dark corners.
Lights&mdash;let me see&mdash;oh, yes, carriage
lamps for lights. An open fire&mdash;we simply
must have that&mdash;it’s the one thing lacking.
Why, Betty Wales, there’s nothing like it
anywhere! People will go crazy over it, and
we shall make our everlasting fortunes. See,
this little room back here&mdash;it’s a harness-room,
I suppose&mdash;is just the thing for the
kitchen. Why, it’s perfect, and the rent will
be a mere song. Come and tell Babbie this
minute.</p>

<p>“And to think that it was Betty and not I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>who had the inspiration!” Madeline sighed, as
she ended her enthusiastic recital to Babbie and
Mary. “When Mrs. Bob and Mrs. Hildreth
are paying me for supplying them, too. It’s
disgraceful.”</p>

<p>“But, Madeline”&mdash;it was the first chance
Betty had had to get in a word&mdash;“I only said
I wondered if it would do, and I’m not sure
yet. Where could we put the range and
the sink in that harness-room? Barns don’t
have furnaces, do they? Even if there could
be an open fire, that wouldn’t make it warm
enough in winter; and I doubt if carriage
lamps would make it light enough. Those
things are even more important than your beloved
features.”</p>

<p>“Betty,” said Madeline severely, “what is
the matter with you? You ought to be dancing
around on one foot in your childish glee.
You’re not a practical person. You weren’t,
I mean, when I knew you.”</p>

<p>“She’s growing up, silly,” Mary Brooks answered,
with an arm around Betty. “And
it’s very lucky she is, if you’re going into this
thing seriously. Now you telephone your
riding-man to see who owns this stable, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>then we can make sure it’s not already rented
again, and that the rent isn’t beyond you.
And if everything is all right so far, Betty
and I will go and look the place over in the
true scientific spirit. You and Babbie can
come along if you like, but I don’t consider it
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Hear the experienced-housekeeper-wife-of-an-experimental
psychologist talk!” jeered
Madeline. “Run along and cast your evil
eye on my scheme if you want to. But it
will work, practical or not practical. It’s
simply too lovely not to work.”</p>

<p>“I adore your logic, Madeline,” declared
Mary admiringly. “You’d better come too,
after all.”</p>

<p>So, first having assured themselves about
the rent, the four set out. Babbie sniffed
daintily as they went inside.</p>

<p>“Everything is to be varnished over,”
Madeline explained, “walls, floor, everything.
Some of the rough places should be planed
down a little, but we’ll leave the dents alone.
It will be a stunning effect in the lamplight&mdash;quite
like an old English castle.”</p>

<p>“The stalls are too narrow for two rows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>of chairs and a reasonably wide table,” announced
Mary, from the depths of one of
them. “The romantic couples will knock
plates.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t have chairs. Build in benches
on the sides, and take away the mangers in
some stalls to make more room for big parties
who prefer to be by themselves&mdash;the getting-into-societies
celebrations and all that kind of
thing.”</p>

<p>“That sounds possible. Now about the
kitchen,” pursued Mary. “Betty, come and
look at this harness-room again. I believe
it might do. There’s running water here
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Babbie sat down on the steps leading to the
loft. “I’ve only said ‘oh’ and ‘ah’ so far,
like the chorus in a Greek play, but just
watch me work at getting us started. And I
may have a bright thought some day.”</p>

<p>Just then the agent arrived, Mary and Betty
came back, and all four girls fired questions
and suggestions at the poor man so fast and
furiously that he lost his head and yielded
every point, promising to shellac the whole
interior, put up a stove that would “heat the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>place red-hot,” and carriage lamps with reflectors
that would make it “blaze with light,”
and a big fireplace at one end of the room,
since Madeline declared it to be an absolute
necessity. And he guaranteed to have the
barn swept and garnished and ready for occupancy
within ten days. Meanwhile the girls
could install the kitchen fittings, and order
their furniture.</p>

<p>“And engage a cook and decent waitresses,”
added Mary portentously. “And if you do
that in ten days I shall be green with envy.”</p>

<p>But Babbie did it, without, as she expressed
it, lifting a little finger. She happened to
meet Belden House Annie on the campus,
and during their interview it developed that
Annie had a pretty sister Nora, who would
gladly come and be waitress, and an Aunt
Bridget, who could “cook to the quane’s taste,
or the prisidint’s.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have ‘quane’s’ style Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays,” suggested Madeline,
“and ‘prisidint’s’ style the rest of the
time. That is, if that idiotic carpenter ever
gets the tables right.”</p>

<p>The carpenter, Madeline declared, was wearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
her to a thread; but Babbie, who was
pricking her pretty fingers hemming table-linen,
and Betty, immersed in lists of pots
and kettles, groceries and silverware, heartlessly
refused to come to her rescue.</p>

<p>So Madeline relieved her mind by much
grumbling, and in the intervals of her supervision
developed new “features” with a joyous
abandon that threatened to reduce the
Hinsdales’ scholastic ménage to chaos. Dr.
Hinsdale came home one afternoon to find his
study darkened, the floor and table strewn
with bits of multi-colored paper and paste-board,
and Madeline, in a studio apron, trying
the effect of her latest inspiration in
candle-shades on the desk lamp.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a different design for
each stall,” she explained cheerfully, without
looking up when the door opened. “That
will be more interesting to make, and when a
thing is interesting to make it’s more likely
to turn out well, isn’t it now? Oh, I thought
it was only Mary! I beg your pardon. I
know I shouldn’t have come in here, but they
had table-cloths and dish-towels spread around
everywhere else. The first day it rains we’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>treat you to a free lunch, Dr. Hinsdale, to pay
up. Oh, you’ve got&mdash;there’s some one else!
Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>As Madeline fled precipitately, she heard
“Prexy’s” pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>“We’re disgraced forever,” she announced
tragically to the sewing-party. “Prexy will
probably proclaim a boycott upon us at to-morrow’s
chapel.”</p>

<p>But he sent word instead, by Professor Hinsdale,
that he wanted to be counted in for the
free lunch.</p>

<p>“He may, if he’ll let us tack our posters
on the campus trees,” agreed Madeline
calmly.</p>

<p>“Posters!” cried Betty and Babbie in a
breath.</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “I’m designing one.
It’s stored under the sofa in Mary’s pink and
gold reception room. I’ll get it. It’s all done
but the name.”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t any name!” cried Babbie.</p>

<p>“I thought you called yourselves Betty
Wales &amp; Co.,” put in Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s what we are, of course,” agreed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>Madeline, reappearing with her poster, “so
we’d better call ourselves something else,
hadn’t we? Everybody can see that Betty is
a regular feature. A name should bring out
unexpected qualities. Besides, Betty wouldn’t
want her name to be stuck up on a sign.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good theory about the unexpected
qualities,” said Mary, “but I’d like to see you
work it.”</p>

<p>Madeline sighed plaintively. “As if it was
anything against a theory that you can’t work
it. I furnish the theory. It’s only fair for
some one else to furnish the name.”</p>

<p>“Old Barn Tea-Shop,” suggested Mary.</p>

<p>“Sounds sentimental,” objected Babbie.</p>

<p>“And rickety,” laughed Betty.</p>

<p>“The Coach-and-Four Tea-Shop,” from
Mary again. “That’s certainly the height of
elegance.”</p>

<p>“But it’s humpy to say,” Madeline told her,
“and possibly a little too elegant for us to live
up to.”</p>

<p>“The Saddle and Stirrup,” was Dr. Hinsdale’s
offering.</p>

<p>“That’s lovely,” declared Madeline, “just
like a quaint old English inn. But it’s too&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
too sophisticated for us. College girls
wouldn’t take to it.”</p>

<p>“Tally-ho Tea-Shop sounds rather neat,”
said Babbie reflectively, “but I don’t know
that it brings out any of Madeline’s unsuspected
features.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it does,” Madeline declared.
“It suggests dash and pleasant glitter and snap&mdash;and
general stuntiness.”</p>

<p>“And ear-splitting horns,” added Mary sarcastically.</p>

<p>“But college girls love to blow horns,” Betty
reminded her.</p>

<p>Mary grinned. “I adore it myself,” she
admitted, “but I try to live up to the dignity
of my position.”</p>

<p>Madeline had been sketching in some letters
rapidly on her poster. “Tally-ho Tea-Shop
fills the space I left most beautifully. I’ll
copy this in oils on thin wood, and we’ll nail
a gargoyle to the big tree in our front yard and
let the sign dangle out of his mouth. Mary,
be a jewel and lend us your gargoyle. Ours
are all needed inside.”</p>

<p>It was certainly a strenuous week.</p>

<p>“If anybody had made us slave the way we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>have over this tea-shop,” Babbie declared, “we
should have called it cruelty to animals and
children. And I don’t believe we could have
done it except up here at Harding, where
everybody throws things together between
classes.”</p>

<p>Just to be sure that everything was “thrown
together,” they gave a private view, on the
evening before the opening day, for the Hinsdales,
Georgia, Polly Eastman, and a few
other chosen spirits, who pronounced the
Tally-ho Tea-Shop “very neat,” “a gem,”
“adorable,” “too cute for words,” or “truly
stunty,” according to their favorite adjectives.
The open fire, the carriage lamps, and the
darkened oak gave just the effect of dim
splendor that Madeline had wanted. The
bits of old brass tempted one to exploring expeditions;
the double-decker bread-trays made
one long to order them filled and eat them
empty.</p>

<p>“When we get the prints and the candle-shades,
it will be about perfect,” declared
Madeline, surveying the scene complacently.</p>

<p>“You need a horseshoe over the door for
luck,” suggested Dr. Hinsdale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>So Georgia rushed out to a near-by stable
to get one, and Dr. Hinsdale nailed it up
while the girls sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Betty, standing with Georgia’s arm around
her, gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? Are you catching
cold?” whispered Georgia anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, nothing,” Betty whispered back.
Well, there wasn’t&mdash;anything at least that
you told people, except perhaps Miss Ferris,
who had been kept from the private view by
an important department meeting. It was
only what K. had once laughingly dubbed
“growing pains,”&mdash;the same frightened feeling
that you had the first time your brother teased
you to swim out over your depth, and you
weren’t a bit sure he could rescue you if you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>went down. Also, it had taken Betty the
whole long afternoon to clean and fill the
carriage lamps that every one was exclaiming
over. Cleaning lamps didn’t come under
the head of either waiting on table or cooking.
Betty wondered, with a tired little sigh,
who would do it all the other days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">EUGENIA FORD’S LUNCHEON</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> success of the Tally-ho Tea-Shop’s
opening day left the amazed proprietors somewhat
aghast. When Babbie Hildreth arrived
at twelve, in a plumed hat and a trained
gown, and with a lunch party of six in tow,
things were already at such a pass that after a
whispered word with Betty she shoved her
guests hastily into the one empty stall, pinned
up her train, tucked her plumed hat under
one of the benches, and proceeded to take
Betty’s place as cashier, so that Betty could go
to the rescue of her well-nigh distracted cook.
At twelve-fifteen Madeline appropriated Polly
Eastman’s runabout and drove at a gallop to
the Hinsdales’ to borrow Mary’s waitress and
a fresh supply of linen and silver. At twelve-thirty
Georgia Ames appeared, very hot and
hungry from a strenuous game of tennis, only
to be mercilessly seized upon by Babbie and
rushed off for more oranges and bananas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p>“They cry for fruit salad like children for
castoria,” declared Babbie fiercely. “And
they have nothing but five dollar bills.
Bring me all the change you can carry.”</p>

<p>At one o’clock the real rush began. Girls
sat on the broad steps or swarmed over the
lawn waiting for vacant tables. At half-past
one Madeline went out to them and explained
that nearly everything was gone, except tea
and bread-and-butter sandwiches; and some
of the girls went off, after having engaged
tables for next day. At half-past five, when
the last of the afternoon tea drinkers had departed,
the managers of the Tally-ho Tea-Shop
held a solemn conclave in the front stall,
their aching feet tucked comfortably under
them on the long benches.</p>

<p>“It was a fright,” said Babbie. “I took
three hundred checks, and money enough to
pay the rent till Christmas. I hope I made
right change some of the time.”</p>

<p>“It’s great,” sighed Madeline, “simply
great! There’ll be perfectly huge profits for
Mrs. Hildreth and Mrs. Bob and me.”</p>

<p>“If this is going to keep up,” put in Betty,
“we’ve got to have more of every single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>thing. I’m afraid we’ve killed off Bridget
already.”</p>

<p>“Send her home in a carriage,” suggested
Madeline recklessly. “Let’s all go home in
a carriage. Speaking of home, I’ve got to
take the sleeper down to-night. Poor Mrs.
Bob has telegraphed twice. You see I told
her to advertise the apartment, and the
would-be tenants are standing on the door-steps
shrieking to get in. I’ll be back here
the first minute I can, though.”</p>

<p>Betty looked at Babbie. “Didn’t you say
your mother had changed her plans and come
home?”</p>

<p>Babbie nodded. “I’ve got to fly back to
her or she’ll get blue and rush me off to Palm
Beach for the whole winter. You’ll be all
right without us, Betty. You must have all
the extra help you want, and if we’re going
to do such a tremendous business I think you
ought to have more salary.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” chorused Madeline, “which is
very sweet of me, considering how it will wipe
out profits.”</p>

<p>“We’d better wait and see whether this rush
keeps up,” advised Betty wisely. “Maybe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>those that came to-day didn’t like it and
won’t come again.”</p>

<p>“Everybody was perfectly crazy over it,”
declared Madeline. “I’m sure it’s all plain
sailing, now that we’ve got started.”</p>

<p>Betty, tucking a complicated marketing
list into her shopping-bag with a still more
complicated memoranda of “things to be attended
to,” said nothing. She wasn’t afraid
of hard work, but the responsibility and the
thought that perhaps she couldn’t possibly get
through it all worried her a good deal. She
could have hugged Georgia Ames next
morning, when that brisk young person,
having banged persistently on the tea-shop
door, finally climbed in the kitchen
window.</p>

<p>“Found you a room,” she announced
breathlessly, “in that little white house in
front. Woman has a big beauty left over,
and you can have it cheap, because it’s so late
in the season. With or without meals. Heard
you say you wanted one. Now send me on
more errands. I’ve got a free morning&mdash;no
classes till twelve, and then only a snap course
in psychology. What? You silly! As if I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>wouldn’t do anything for you after the way
you treated me last year.”</p>

<p>It was Georgia who suggested applying to
the Students’ Aid for more waitresses and who,
when the Students’ Aid insisted that it couldn’t
be expected to provide them on less than a
day’s notice, sought out the spendthrift Dutton
twins and pressed them into Betty’s service.</p>

<p>“They’re always poor after the second of
the month, aren’t you, my children?” she
asked them, as they presented themselves in
two of Nora’s aprons, flushed and giggling,
for Betty’s inspection. “Your hair is in a
mess, as usual, Fluffy. Remember, Straight,
your right hand is the one you take notes
with&mdash;if you ever do take notes. Now run
out to the kitchen, and Bridget and Nora will
show you where things are. And remember
it’s only a lark to you, but you mustn’t queer
the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.”</p>

<p>These instructions they faithfully obeyed,
seeking out Betty later to tell her so.</p>

<p>“And we think we ought to have our lunch
extra,” the fluffy-haired twin explained, “because
all our little pals came in to see us do
our stunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“And we egged them on to have all sorts
of expensive things, more than they’d meant
to order,” added her straight-haired sister.
“Besides, we want to save our wages for
lucky pieces.”</p>

<p>But while they were eating the lunch that
was “extra,” Lucile Merrifield came in, and
being noisily invited to join them, ate up the
lucky pieces and much more, while she listened
to the twins’ joyous account of their new
“stunt.” “So the lunch wasn’t exactly extra
after all,” said the fluffy-haired twin as she
paid the bill, “because we egged Lucile on
too. Extravagance is a good quality in a
waitress, isn’t it, Miss Wales? I shall write
my father that. It may tickle him so that
he’ll raise our allowance, and if he does we’ll
be right down here giving a party.”</p>

<p>After the first fortnight things began to
settle themselves into a more businesslike
routine. The girls Betty knew, having recklessly
indulged themselves during the tea-shop’s
first week, were obliged to be content
with campus fare for a while. One noon she
realized with a little start of amazement that
there wasn’t a girl that she knew in the room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>Some of them doubtless knew her. Most of
them had probably heard that she was a
Harding girl, who was suddenly obliged to
earn her living. Well, wasn’t she? And
hadn’t she wanted to go into a really and
truly business, and been almost sorry that in
Harding everything was too much fun to
seem like real work?</p>

<p>“We’ve been waiting a perfect age,” announced
somebody over her shoulder. “Will
you send a waitress, please, right away? You
ought to give good service, you know, when
you’re just starting in.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a tall, overdressed girl,
with a scowl and a mouth that drooped at the
corners. Betty remembered distinctly having
seen her come in only a minute before. But
she said, “I’m sorry,” and took the order out
to the kitchen herself.</p>

<p>When Bridget had served it in a hurry,
Betty heard the tall girl laugh disagreeably.
“Wasn’t that neat?” she demanded of her
companion. “I can always get what I want.
Maybe she did see us come in; she couldn’t
say so. That’s the way to treat tradespeople,
even if they have been to college.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>That very afternoon, while the tall girl’s
speech still rankled in Betty’s memory, recalling
other petty slights and snubs, Miss
Eugenia Ford rustled in to order a luncheon
for twelve for the next noon.</p>

<p>Eugenia Ford was small and fair, and as
exquisitely dainty and delicate as a French
doll. She was universally conceded to be the
prettiest girl in the entering class, and the
petting she had received had gone to her head.</p>

<p>“If her grandmother dies before long, she
may get a little real expression into her face,
and then she’ll be the college beauty,” somebody
had said about her.</p>

<p>“It will take heaps more than losing her
grandmother to put any expression into Eugenia’s
face,” Georgia Ames had retorted wisely.</p>

<p>At present Eugenia was certainly as vain
and frivolous as she was pretty, and very
badly spoiled indeed.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Miss&mdash;Miss Welch,” she
began in businesslike tones.</p>

<p>“Wales,” suggested Betty, smiling at the
child because she was so pretty, and because
she had been so comical about gargles and
gargoyles at Georgia’s party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Wales.” Eugenia accepted the correction
gravely. “I want a table for twelve persons
to-morrow, for a one o’clock luncheon. This
is the menu that I want served. I shall have
my flowers sent here, and I suppose you can
arrange them. Here are my place-cards, and
this list gives the order that I want them arranged
in. I want the front stall.” Eugenia
completed her directions without relaxing one
iota of her unsmiling dignity.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Betty told her, “but the front
stall is engaged for to-morrow. You can have
the third&mdash;that’s just as large&mdash;or the big
round table out here.”</p>

<p>“But I like the candle-shades in the first
stall better,” announced Eugenia calmly.
“Change them to the third, and give me
that. And please serve us very promptly,
because some of the girls have afternoon engagements.”
And Eugenia started off.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Ford,” Betty called after
her, “but the girl who engaged the first
stall particularly wanted those candle-shades.
They are understood to belong to the stall,
you know.”</p>

<p>Eugenia’s smooth white forehead puckered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>itself into a disagreeable frown. “Very
well,” she said crossly, “but you ought to
have two sets of that kind of shade. They’re
the only pretty ones in the place.” And she
rustled off, annoyance in every line of her
dainty little figure.</p>

<p>Betty smiled sadly after her. “I suppose
she’s forgotten that she ever met me. Freshmen
have so many people to remember.
Madeline will be pleased to know her opinion
of all those candle-shades that she’s so proud
of.”</p>

<p>Betty arranged Eugenia’s roses herself, and
inspected every detail of the table with great
care. Last of all she put around the place-cards
in the order that Eugenia had specified.
Georgia’s name was on one, and Lucile’s, and
Polly’s, and the fluffy-haired Dutton twins’&mdash;the
one who wrote such cunning verses and
was sure to go into Dramatic Club the first
time. It was plainly what Katherine used to
call a “polite, politic” luncheon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Eugenia she was late in
arriving&mdash;or her guests were early. When
she hurried in, looking prettier than ever because
her cheeks were flushed with her quick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>walk down the hill and her eyes sparkling in
anticipation of a triumphant occasion, she
found Georgia, Polly, Lucile, and the Dutton
twins all hanging over Betty’s desk, so absorbed
in their conversation that they entirely
failed to notice the advent of their
small hostess.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are,” began Eugenia, with a
vague little nod toward the group. “Shall
we go and sit down while we wait for the
others? Our table is all ready, I think.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Betty, and give us the rest of it
while we’re waiting,” coaxed Lucile, pulling
Betty toward Eugenia. “She’s been telling
us how Babe the man-hater fell in love. It’s
a joyous tale. You met Babe, Eugenia, when
she was up this fall&mdash;and you’ve met Betty
Wales, of course.”</p>

<p>Eugenia looked gravely at Betty. “Yes, I
believe I’ve met Miss Wales,” she said.</p>

<p>“Of course, at my gargoyle party,” put in
Georgia. “Go on, Betty, about that fascinating
Paris pension, and their rubbering out
into the garden and planning to have breakfast
together every morning.”</p>

<p>Betty, watching Eugenia, shook her head,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>with a brave little smile. “Some other time.
I’m busy now. That is, I can’t desert my
post to play with you, as I’ve told you all
sixty times before.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go and sit down?” asked
Eugenia again, sweetly. And as they filed
off, her clear high voice came back distinctly
to Betty. “I didn’t ask her to come,” she
was explaining to Georgia, “because I think
it’s much better not to mix business and society,
don’t you, Miss Ames? Of course if I
saw her up on the campus I should be nice to
her. But here it’s rather awkward, because
some of my friends would think it was awfully
funny to be introduced to the cashier.”</p>

<p>Betty couldn’t hear Georgia’s low, emphatic
retort, but she could guess at its tenor, and
later, when Polly Eastman leaned around the
edge of the stall, wearing her widest, most
provoking smile, and waved her handkerchief,
she could imagine how she and Lucile
and the Dutton twins were making poor
Eugenia’s life a burden to her by those subtle
methods of persecution that had won the trio
their reputation for being the best friends and
the worst enemies that a Harding girl could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>have. It was four to one, and Betty pitied
poor Eugenia, who felt the hostile atmosphere&mdash;without
in the least understanding what it
meant, and spent the afternoon writing a
tearful letter to her boarding-school chum,
all about the hatefulness of Harding upper-class
girls who were “too sweet for anything”
one minute and “perfectly horrid”
the next. She thought she would leave at
Christmas time, she wrote, even if her father
had said she couldn’t keep changing her
mind. Then she made out a check to the
Tally-ho Tea-Shop for her luncheon and
mailed it, with a disagreeable little note,
complaining of the waitress’s awkwardness
and too much pepper in the soup. “The
table wasn’t decently laid, either, and the
flowers were a mess,” she concluded, and addressed
the note to “Miss Welch.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Georgia Ames gets back for
calling me an idiotic little snob,” muttered
Eugenia, as she posted her letters.</p>

<p>Eugenia’s note, which Betty couldn’t find
time to read until late the next afternoon,
was the last straw in the load of a very hard
day. The week before, business had been so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>dull that Betty had reluctantly decided to dispense
with two of the Students’ Aid
waitresses, and, having tried to choose the
ones who could best do without the money,
she had screwed up her courage and explained
the situation. They had both cried,
and now, the very day after they were gone,
the Tally-ho Tea-Shop was crowded to overflowing,
and poor Nora and her one remaining
assistant fairly ran back and forth between
the kitchen and the stalls in their
efforts not to keep impatient customers waiting.
Then everybody had been seized with a
mad desire for English muffins just on the
very day when Bridget had decided only to
make up a few, and the sandwiches that there
never had been enough of before were all left
over. Several people had complained that
they could never get what they ordered, and
some had gone away. Betty stood it until
five o’clock, and then, confiding to the
Students’ Aid waitress that she felt as if she
should fly, she left her in charge and went up
to see Miss Ferris.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble now, little girl?” demanded
Miss Ferris, when she had established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>Betty in a big easy chair by the open fire,
with a box of chocolates at her elbow.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Betty bravely, “or at least
there oughtn’t to be anything. What would
you do, Miss Ferris, if things that you knew
oughtn’t to bother you, bothered you awfully
all the same?”</p>

<p>Miss Ferris considered. Anybody else
would have said, “What things, for instance?”
but Miss Ferris never asked stupid
questions like that. She only smiled back at
you and read what she wanted to know in
your face.</p>

<p>“Well,” she began slowly after a minute,
“I’d go to bed very early, so as to get well
rested, and next morning I’d look around to
find somebody with a big, real trouble that I
could help, perhaps&mdash;or try to help anyhow.
And first of all I’d take off my hat and stay
to dinner at the Hilton.”</p>

<p>When Betty bid Miss Ferris good-night
after a merry evening in the Hilton House
parlors, she was her smiling self again.</p>

<p>“I’m all right even without the going-to-bed-early
part,” she declared eagerly. “The
things I can’t help I won’t worry about. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>things I oughtn’t to mind I won’t mind&mdash;not
one little speck. I guess that disposes of all
my troubles, and the first thing to-morrow
I’ll begin hunting for somebody to help. I
don’t believe I’ve thought much about helping
lately&mdash;except helping father by earning
this money. Things are so different&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not,” Miss Ferris cut her
short, “because you’re the very same Betty
Wales.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” Betty wondered, as she buttoned
the coat of her last year’s suit and ran
down the hill. “I suppose I am. Now
there’s Rachel&mdash;she couldn’t be any dearer if
she owned a gold mine. Besides, I promised
father I wouldn’t care and I won’t.”</p>

<span class="smaller">MARY, THE PERFECT PATRON</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeline</span> had been gone for three weeks
and never sent so much as a line of “inspirations”
back to the Tally-ho Tea-Shop, when
the expressman drove up one morning with a
great mahogany writing-desk for Betty, with
“Sent by M. Ayres” on the shipping ticket.
On one of the lovely old-fashioned brass
knobs was tied a note, and Betty stopped unpacking
the desk to read it.</p>

<p>“The chief joy of having a tea-shop,”
Madeline wrote, “is that it grows on your
hands. I never was quite satisfied with your
desk. A harness cupboard, with a covered
watering trough underneath it, ought to have
made a picturesque and Tally-ho-ish effect,
but some way it didn’t. Yesterday I went
out into the country to meditate on my
Literary Career, and at the little old inn
where I lunched I saw the very thing, which
I enclose herewith. (That’s what I say to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>the editors about my stories. I hope you’ll
like the enclosure well enough to keep it,
which is a thing no editor has done yet.)</p>

<p>“Isn’t the inlay lovely, and don’t you adore
the bulgy little compartments? There’s also
a secret drawer&mdash;not the fake kind that anybody
can open after a little hunting, but the
real thing. I got all these fascinating features
for a song, with the recipe for the most luscious
cake thrown in&mdash;literally thrown in, Miss
Betty Wales. Open the secret drawer, and
you’ll find it. (Ha! ha! A lively hunt you’ll
have first.) It’s called Aunt Martha’s cake,
and if it doesn’t make a hit for the Tally-ho,
I shall lose faith in the Harding appetite.</p>

<p>“Now don’t look solemn and sigh over the
wild extravagance of all good Bohemians,
Betty dear. If you feel that the Tally-ho
can’t afford the desk just now, why, Mrs. Bob
Enderby is crazy about it, and she’ll give the
firm exactly twice what I paid. Get little
Mary Brooks to bidding against her, and we
shan’t have to worry over dull times.</p>

<p>“I am sending this with the desk, because
my Literary Career takes all the postage stamps
I can afford,&mdash;and then some. Dick Blake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>says that writing is exactly like painting.
You’ve got to learn how. He calls my stories
‘beginner’s daubs&mdash;promising, but daubs.’
I’ve talked to a lot of other discouraging people,
and I’ve got hundreds of plans, and
several inspirations for B. W. &amp; Co., so I’m
coming back to-morrow to settle down for
what Katherine calls a little spell of work.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, but I shall be glad to see her
and talk things over!” Betty said to herself,
and looked up to find Mary Brooks standing
in the door, smiling in her vague, near-sighted
fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is you,” she said, as Betty hurried
to meet her. “Are you all by yourself?
Where are the members of the ‘Why-Get-Up-to-Breakfast Club’?”</p>

<p>Betty laughed and then looked sober. “It’s
almost as nice a name as the ‘Merry Hearts,’
isn’t it? They’ve stopped coming here lately.
I wish I knew why.”</p>

<p>“Give them buckwheat griddle-cakes,” advised
Mary promptly. “Cuyler has nothing
but wheat ones. Tell Lucile to tell everybody
that yours are heaps nicer. What’s that in the
crate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Betty explained, and Mary, who adored old
writing-desks and had been hunting for years
for one just to her liking, pulled off her gloves
in great excitement and helped unpack the
desk, move it into a sunny alcove between the
front door and a window, and hunt for the
secret drawer.</p>

<p>“It’s exactly what I want,” she declared
rapturously, after they had spent half an hour
without finding any trace of the recipe for
Aunt Martha’s cake. “I’ll give you ten dollars
more than your Mrs. Bob offered. But
you mustn’t sell it to either of us, Betty. A
secret drawer is a splendid tea-room feature.
It suggests all kinds of romantic mysteries.”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “Of course, I should just
love to have it here, but we can’t afford it.
We haven’t done a bit well lately, Mary.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Try the buckwheat griddle-cakes,” Mary
called over her shoulder, as she hurried off to
meet her husband at the end of his eleven
o’clock class.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo2"><img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="400" alt="SHE STOPPED THE GIRLS AS THEY WENT OUT"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">SHE STOPPED THE GIRLS AS THEY WENT OUT</p>

<p class="p2">But directly after luncheon she was back
again. “I’m bound to find that drawer before
Madeline comes, so we can crow over her,”
she explained. “Besides, George Garrison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>Hinsdale is writing a paper for a philosophical
society with a name a yard long, and he’s most
dreadfully cross. So I thought that as I can’t
help talking and looking frivolous, I’d better
go away. Shall I bother here?”</p>

<p>Mary hunted for the secret drawer in the
same sociable fashion in which she evidently
expected Dr. Hinsdale to write a paper for his
learned society. She stopped the girls as they
went out, to ask if they knew anything about
secret springs, and she soon had an animated,
admiring group around her, eagerly examining
the points of Betty’s treasure, and incidentally
revealing to the astute Mary their
opinions of the Tally-ho Tea-Shop and drinking
in her casual references to delicious crispy
brown buckwheat griddle-cakes and to the
wonderful new recipe in the desk, that would
certainly come to light before long.</p>

<p>About four o’clock, in the lull between
lunch and afternoon tea, Mary detached herself
self from the girls around the desk and buttonholed
Betty in a secluded corner.</p>

<p>“I always knew I had a head for business,”
she began modestly. “The reason they don’t
come in to feed isn’t because they don’t like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>the eats, but because they’re saving up money
for Christmas. Don’t you remember how we
used to do that? At least,” added Mary,
with a reminiscent smile, “I used to mean to
save, but in the end I always sent home for an
extra check.”</p>

<p>“I know,” agreed Betty. “But what can
you do about it? It’s just one of the drawbacks
of the tea-room business, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mary surveyed her smilingly. “Don’t you
really see what to do?” she inquired impressively.
“Why, my child, it’s as plain as two
and two. Open a gift-shop department, of
course.” Mary paused for the full splendor
of her idea to dawn upon Betty.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but this is a tea-room,” began Betty
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” Mary took her up, “and
if people won’t buy enough tea, you have to
give them griddle-cakes, don’t you? And if
they don’t jump at griddle-cakes, you’ve got
to find out what they will jump at. That’s
business. What you want is their money.
You’ve got plenty of room for a long table of
fol-de-rols over there in the corner. They’ll
hear about it and come in to buy Christmas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>presents, and they’ll see Aunt Martha’s cake
melting in their friends’ mouths and have to
have some. While they’re eating, they’ll remember
that they haven’t bought a thing for
their own dear Aunt Martha. So they’ll hop
up and pick out more Christmas things. See?
That’s Association of Ideas, my child. George
Garrison Hinsdale is writing his paper about
it. I’m going home this minute to tell him
that I know how it works, and also to give
him his tea, which is an idea that he associates
with me. I’ll be in to-morrow, to see if you’ve
found the drawer.”</p>

<p>The more Betty thought of the gift-shop
department the better she liked the idea.
They could make a specialty of Tally-ho candle-shades
and one or two other things that
Madeline could be trusted to think up. The
Students’ Aid girls that she had been obliged
to dismiss could take charge of the table&mdash;“I
shan’t have it look a bit like a counter,” Betty
reflected, remembering the unpleasant remark
about tradespeople&mdash;during her own busiest
hours. Some of the other girls who were
earning their own way might like to put work
on sale there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Pretty things would surely sell better
here than from the bulletin-board in the
gym,” Betty decided swiftly, “and that’s a
way to help. We might take orders for
mending and copying and such things, too.
The girls who come here are the very ones
who have money to spend, and I’m sure lots
of them don’t bother to hunt up Students’ Aid
girls, when they want work done. Why, this
is more helpful than I ever could be when I
was in college! Miss Ferris was right&mdash;she
always is. We’ll do it! I must consult Babbie
and Madeline first, of course.”</p>

<p>But Mary, appearing bright and early the
next morning, scoffed at delays.</p>

<p>“George Garrison Hinsdale looked as if he
wanted to put me in storage till lunch time,”
she explained, “so I can work for you the
whole morning if you’ll only decide now.
Anyway, we know Madeline is for it. Don’t
you remember she said in her letter that she
liked tea-rooms because they grow on your
hands? Well, this is a beautiful example of
growth. And you and Madeline are a majority,
though I’m sure Babbie will be for it
too. Now I’ve thought of a lovely new kind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>of Tally-ho candle-shade with little bunches
of oats for fringe. I’m going to fix up a
workroom for the gift-shop department in
the loft. I’ve brought down oceans of things
in here,” and Mary emptied paste, paints and
brushes, scissors, a sewing kit, and a miscellaneous
collection of scraps of paper, which
she explained were designs for Christmas
cards, out of a very stylish shopping-bag, borrowed
Betty’s biggest apron, and proceeded to
improvise a work-table out of two sawhorses
and an old storm door. But having laid out
her implements on it, she discovered to her
dismay that the workroom would be plainly
visible to the inmates of the third stall, and
she came down to consult Betty about the
most artistic color for a curtain to screen her
from the curious public below.</p>

<p>“For this gift business is to be a secret, you
know,” she explained to Betty, “until you’re
ready to spring it on them. Not exactly a
dead secret, but the interesting half-way kind.
Madeline knows how to manage secrets. And
speaking of Madeline, here she comes.”</p>

<p>Madeline approved the new departure so
vehemently that she would hardly wait to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>shake hands before she was up in the loft investigating
Mary’s arrangements, and emptying
the miscellaneous contents of her suit-case
out on the floor, to find a “spook” candle-shade,
that the little artist, whose cousins had
once had a tea-room, had designed for the
new adventurers in the same field. When
you examined it, you saw just a confused
mass of red, blue, green, yellow, and white
spots separated by broad black lines; but with
the light behind them the spots resolved themselves
in a big yellow Tally-ho coach drawn
by white horses, who pranced grandly up to
a red-roofed inn on the next panel, with a
green lawn in front of it and green trees and
blue sky behind.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it too cute?” Betty declared enthusiastically.
“It ought to be our very specialest
specialty, oughtn’t it, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Mary grudgingly.
“They’ll take loads of time to make, though.
There’ll be more real profit in mine. I must
get some oats for my kind, while I’m out buying
the curtain. Why, it’s noon already&mdash;I
must fly! Madeline, come down and show us
the secret drawer before I go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Madeline had appropriated a piece of Mary’s
cardboard and was tracing the design of the
“specialest specialty” on it.</p>

<p>She shook her head absently. “It’s a trade
secret, only for members of the firm. Perhaps,
if you don’t call me ‘my child’ too
often, and make us some terribly cute shades
and cards, we’ll let you into it by and by.”</p>

<p>“You ought to let her in right away,” declared
Betty loyally. “I was getting just
dreadfully blue, with you and Babbie away,
and first she thought of buckwheat griddle-cakes
and then of this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m the very Perfect Patron,” Mary
chimed in eagerly, “and I ask you where any
business would be without patrons? They’re
as necessary as the firm, if not more so.”</p>

<p>Madeline stopped work to smile benignly
at her. “Mary, the Perfect Patron,” she repeated,
“your logic is irresistible. Your distinguished
husband ought to be very proud
of you. I’ll tell you what, Betty, I’ll make
out a set of Rules for the Perfect Patron, and
if Mary agrees to abide by them she shall be
duly initiated with the rite of the Secret
Drawer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“I agree to anything, if you’ll only show
me that drawer right off,” begged Mary.</p>

<p>But Madeline was inexorable. “It is the
present duty of the committee on Inspirations
to see if it can copy this candle-shade,” she
said. “And I may add that it is the duty of
the Perfect Wife to be on time for meals.
And the moral of that is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!” supplied Mary, who
had been consulting a diminutive watch, and
now rushed down the stairs murmuring sadly,
“It must be fast, but I thought it was slow
this morning.”</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure that I can find that
drawer again, myself,” Madeline confided to
Betty, when they were alone. “It’s an awfully
complicated arrangement.”</p>

<p>But that night just before they closed the
tea-room, Madeline found the combination,
after a little preliminary fumbling, and
proudly entrusted to Betty the much-vaunted
recipe for Aunt Martha’s cake.</p>

<p>“Let’s see.” She went over the formula.
“First you press a spring that opens this
panel. Then you pull out that drawer.
There’s a second spring back of that, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>false bottom that comes up, and then a spring
to open the secret drawer. I shan’t forget it
again. The woman who sold the desk to me
said she thought there was some way of working
the whole combination at once, but I don’t
believe there can be.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t put anything in there if you’re
ever going away again,” Betty declared, “for
I never could get it out, unless you write
down the rules for me.”</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head vigorously.
“Don’t you see, dearie, that the whole idea
of a secret drawer is not to have the rules
written down where anybody can get at
them? Sometimes things get lost in secret
drawers for a generation or two, and it’s so
lovely having your grandfather’s will or your
great-aunt’s love-letters, or your wicked uncle’s
confession of a murder he committed, tumble
out some day unexpectedly, just because you
touched a spring that you didn’t even know
was in existence. But the rules for the Perfect
Patron are a different matter. I shall
devote my evening to composing them.”
Madeline sighed deeply. “I suppose I ought
to devote it to my Literary Career. I simply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>mustn’t neglect that, Betty, even to make
extra-special Tally-ho candle-shades.” She
sighed again. “The trouble with a Literary
Career is that you work on it for ages, and
you’ve got nothing to show for your trouble
but a story that ten editors have turned down.
Whereas a candle-shade is a candle-shade, and
a Rule for a Perfect Patron is sure to be
amusing at least to yourself. Let’s see&mdash;‘First
Rule for the Perfect Patron: Don’t
act patronizing to the Firm; confine
your patronage to the menu.’ How’s that,
Betty?”</p>

<p>“Lovely!” declared Betty with enthusiasm.
“Only Mary never can do it. She loves to
call us my children.”</p>

<p>“That’s the point of the rule,” explained
Madeline sagely. “Little Mary has got to
work hard before we initiate her into the rite
of the Secret Drawer. If I can think up
enough joyous impossibilities for rules we
might organize a Perfect Patrons’ Society,
limited to six members.” Madeline threw
aside her pencil and paper and curled up
comfortably on Betty’s couch. “I foresee,”
she announced blandly, “that the secret
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>drawer is going to be our prize feature.
First rule for tea-rooms: Take care of the
features, and the patrons will take care of
you.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only trouble with the gift-shop department
was that it went too well. When
Madeline and Mary had each made a dozen
candle-shades and Betty had decorated some
cards and blotters and secured a few pretty
samples from needy undergraduates, Madeline
painted a “postscript sign” to hang like a
pendant from the big one in the gargoyle’s
mouth, and tacked a gay poster, announcing
the Tally-ho’s new departure, on to the barn
door. By five o’clock that night all the
shades, except those reserved for samples, and
nearly all the cards were sold, and there was
an order list for the “extra special” shades
that Madeline declared would be the utter
ruin of her Literary Career. The workshop
in the loft fairly hummed with activity.
Mary Brooks was its presiding genius. Dr.
Hinsdale continued to work on his learned
paper, so it was a mercy, Mary said, waving
aside Betty’s thanks, that she had something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>to work on too. Every morning and nearly
every afternoon she fluttered in, to see how
things were getting on.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought up a splendid idea,” she
would call, as she climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>Or, “Dreamed a scrumptious rhyme in the
night, Madeline, for the cards with the half
wreaths on them.”</p>

<p>Or, “I’ve heard of a girl who makes the
loveliest stenciled things. Will she be reliable
about filling orders? How in the world
should I know about that, Betty Wales?”</p>

<p>That was Betty’s part&mdash;to make the undergraduates
fill orders according to their agreements,
to keep accounts for them and for
Madeline and her assistants, to sift Mary’s
“splendid ideas,” discarding the impractical
and arranging to have the useful ones
carried out, to spur on Madeline’s enthusiasm,
and to help, whenever she could
find a spare moment, with the actual work of
making the pretty novelties for sale.</p>

<p>“Let’s stop. We’ve earned lots of money
now, and I’m tired to death of cutting queer-shaped
holes in cardboard,” Madeline would
complain at least once every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be business,” Betty insisted
firmly. “It isn’t but three weeks now before
Christmas, and then we shall have to stop for
a while at least. I’ll hire some girls to make
the shades and you can show them how and
then do cards for a while. No, think up
some perfectly new thing. The new things
take best.” Betty tactfully didn’t add “and
keep you interested and at work best.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got an idea for a story,” Madeline
would grumble.</p>

<p>“Can’t it wait? Think of all the stamps
you can buy with this money,” Betty suggested
craftily.</p>

<p>“I’m getting to be dreadfully diplomatic,”
she confided to Mary Brooks. “I used to
hate the girls who were like that&mdash;Jean Eastman
and her crowd. But now I scheme in
all kinds of ways to get Madeline to do as I
wish, and to keep Bridget good-natured, and
make the customers think they’d a lot rather
have English muffins, if the sandwiches are
all gone.”</p>

<p>“You are developing a hard case of executive
ability, my child,” Mary told her. “It’s
perfectly comical, because you look so young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>and innocent with all that curly hair. By
the way, Betty, hasn’t Bridget a recipe for
cookies that you can christen ‘Cousin Kate’s’?
I’ve been talking to ever so many girls about
their relatives, and it seems as if they all had
a Cousin Kate. And then by association of
ideas, you see, they’d buy more presents.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t Dr. Hinsdale finished his paper?”
laughed Betty. “Because if he has you
mustn’t bother too much about us, Mary.
You’ve helped us now more than we can ever
thank you for. You certainly ought to take
the money for your candle-shades.”</p>

<p>“Remember you three girls made me
famous as a hostess, through the length and
breadth of Harding,” Mary told her. “I’ve
got to even up for that. And Madeline has
half promised that if I’m a very Perfect
Patron indeed till Christmas she’ll show me
the secret drawer. I think I’ll go up and make
her promise me fair and square before I go to
work on this new order-list.”</p>

<p>It was rather early for afternoon tea
drinkers, but Betty didn’t like to follow
Mary and leave the tea-room alone; and
Nora was busy in the kitchen helping Bridget
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>to transform chicken salad left over from
lunch into “our special tea-sandwiches.” So
she sat down at her desk and was soon so
deep in the auditing of her weekly accounts
that she didn’t hear the door open, nor see a
tall young man stop just inside to look around
the room with an appreciative smile and then
cross hesitatingly to her desk, his smile growing
broader as he found himself still unnoticed.</p>

<p>“Is there a sign anywhere: ‘No men
allowed within’?” he asked, finally.</p>

<p>Betty looked up with a little gasp of surprise,
and the tall young man bowed to her
over the desk, still smiling reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, there isn’t any sign of that kind,”
Betty explained hastily. “The one on the
door is about our new gift-shop department.
The snow-storm last night washed it almost
out, and we haven’t had time yet to make a
new one. I suppose I might at least take it
down.” Betty started toward the door, but
the tall young man barred her way.</p>

<p>“Let me take it down for you,” he suggested,
“while you get me some tea. Because
if there isn’t any sign&mdash;but perhaps you just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>depend on the general understanding that
seems to pervade this manless town.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Betty assured him hospitably.
“We’re very glad to have men come here.
They often do&mdash;or at least,” she added truthfully,
“several have since we opened.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said the young man gaily.
“All right then, since I may stay, I should
like a pot of tea&mdash;a very big pot, please, with
lots of hot water, and lots of cream, and lots
of crackers spread very thick with strawberry
jam. Now I’ll pull down the sign while
you’re getting the tea.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Betty demurely. “Which
table do you prefer?”</p>

<p>“This,” said the young man promptly,
pointing to the small one in the alcove, close
to Betty’s desk.</p>

<p>When she came back after having left his
order with Nora, he was pacing up and down
the room, examining the old brasses with interest,
peering into each stall and nodding
approvingly as he whirled the double-decker
bread-trays, patted the fat mustard jars, and
inspected all the different varieties of candle-shades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“I say,” he began, when he saw Betty, “if
you put in those nails on the door, you did a
very good job. I can’t get them out. Have
you a hammer?”</p>

<p>It was zero weather outside, and the young
man had no overcoat. When he came in
again with the remains of the poster under
his arm, he was shivering with the cold.
Betty, who was sure that he was a gentleman,
even if he did have rather a queer way of
talking, felt that the least she could do was
to bring a chair close to the fire and poke the
logs into a blaze for him; and of course he
insisted upon doing the poking for her, and
that led to more conversation.</p>

<p>“It’s a jolly little place you’ve got here,”
he said, leaving the fire to examine the motley
array of pretty trifles that covered the gift-table.
“I saw it yesterday as I drove up from
the station, and I realized that it would
probably save my life. You see, I’ve been
years in England, and I’m awfully addicted
to afternoon tea. If I had my way, we’d
serve it regularly at the factory, but a lot of
more important things must come first, so I
shan’t queer myself by mentioning anything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>so frivolous as tea yet a while&mdash;especially when
I can just climb the fence and drop in here.
I say,” he added quickly, “you don’t mind
my coming in over the fence, do you? It’s
licks shorter.”</p>

<p>“Over the fence?” repeated Betty slowly.
“Why, I didn’t know there was a fence.”
She glanced out of the front window, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Oh, not over there on the college side,”
explained the young man impatiently. “Behind,
between you and the stocking factory.
I’m not a new college professor. I’m attached
to the stocking factory.”</p>

<p>Nora brought in his tea just then, and he
drank it very fast and quite in silence.</p>

<p>“I shall be in to-morrow,” he told Betty, as
he paid his bill, “and I shall want the same
things, except orange marmalade instead of
the jam. Could you have it all ready for me
at four? You see this break in the middle of
the afternoon is&mdash;er&mdash;rather unauthorized, so
I can’t be gone long.”</p>

<p>Betty promised and he hurried off, while
Madeline and Mary, who had been listening
and peeping surreptitiously from behind their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>curtain, rushed down to tease Betty and watch
her visitor climb the fence. It was five feet
high and of solid boards, but he vaulted it
easily, and they watched him sprint up the
snowy slope on the other side and disappear
through a basement door into the great factory
that crowned the hill.</p>

<p>“Who in the world can he be?” demanded
Mary excitedly. “I didn’t suppose that kind
of man worked in a factory. He might be the
owner, but apparently he’s only just come
upon the scene for the first time.”</p>

<p>“A new manager, probably, of a very
superior brand,” Madeline suggested. “He
certainly has some authority, because he talked
about making changes. But he didn’t act a
bit businesslike. We’ll just have to call him
Young-Man-Over-the-Fence and await developments.
Hist! Customers approach, and must
not discover me in my work-apron.” And
Madeline rushed headlong up the stairs, and
slipped behind the curtain just in time to
escape a merry party of freshmen seeking refreshment
after a “regular terror” of a written
lesson in Latin.</p>

<p>“I was going to have tea to-day myself,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>Mary told Betty, “but I think I’ll wait till to-morrow&mdash;at
four exactly. Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
must learn not to expect a tête-à-tête
thrown in with the tea.”</p>

<p>But the gentleman in question appeared
not at all put out, when he arrived next day
punctually on the stroke of four, to find a
dainty little lady, who smiled demurely down
into her teacup, in possession of his chosen
table, and a white-capped maid ready to intercept
his progress to Betty’s desk with the information
that his tea would be served in one
minute, at the table by the fire or in one of the
stalls, just as he preferred.</p>

<p>He didn’t even glance in Betty’s direction
as he slipped silently into a chair by the fire,
looking tired and dejected somehow, and staring
gloomily into a dusky corner straight
ahead of him while he waited. But he had a
sudden smile and a “thank you” for Nora
when she hurried back with his tray, and he
ate and drank with evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You don’t ask enough for your tea,” he told
Betty, after having carefully ascertained from
Nora that one always paid one’s bill at the desk.
“I ought to be charged three prices for such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>very big pot. Did you say I have been charged
an extra big price?” He shook his head
dubiously. “I don’t believe you make enough
then. And I say, is it permissible for customers
to make suggestions&mdash;not complaints,
you understand, but hints for improvements?
Well, in my father’s English stables the name
of each horse and a picture of it is nailed up at
the head of the stall. Don’t you think that
would take well here?” He waved his hand
toward the stalls. “Winona, Prince, Down-and-Out,
Vixen, King o’ Spades&mdash;you get the
idea? And little colored prints fastened just
below the names.”</p>

<p>“I think that would be splendid,” Betty told
him cordially. “It would be a real feature,
to be able to order your lunch served in Vixen’s
stall or Prince’s, instead of just in the third or
first. I’ll tell Madeline&mdash;I mean Miss Ayres&mdash;and
I’m sure she’ll see to it.”</p>

<p>“Is she the decorating committee?” inquired
the young man. “Because if so, she’s
certainly to be congratulated. And does she
also make the pretty things on that table?
I’m coming over here for lunch some day, and
then I shall have time to select Christmas gifts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>Marmalade again to-morrow, please. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon he came carrying a handful
of scarlet pepper berries. “I had a lot sent
on from California,” he explained, “to brighten
up our barracks over there. They’ll fit in
beautifully here, won’t they?”</p>

<p>“He’s heard about the Perfect Patrons’
Society,” Mary declared, “and he’s trying to
qualify for membership. Let him in on condition
that he explains himself. I’m simply
bursting with curiosity.”</p>

<p>But Young-Man-Over-the-Fence came for his
tea, calmly oblivious of the interest he had
aroused. He generally arrived tired and listless,
and he always hurried out smiling.</p>

<p>“You will save my life yet,” he told Betty
gaily one day. “I generally forget to go to
lunch, but I never pass up my tea. If ever I
should, Nora must run up the hill and remind
me&mdash;no, that would be a lot of trouble for her,
because she couldn’t climb the fence, and it’s
further round by the street.”</p>

<p>“Then you mustn’t forget,” Betty insisted.
“And I’m sure you oughtn’t to miss your
lunch either,” she added gravely. “It must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>be very bad for your health. Is the stocking
business so absorbing?”</p>

<p>The young man laughed good-humoredly.
“It’s not the stocking business exactly that’s
absorbing; it’s the people who make the
stockings. There’s a little Italian boy whose
hand was caught in a machine yesterday
morning. He was responsible for my passing
up yesterday’s lunch. And there are two old
men&mdash;Russians&mdash;who know hardly a word of
English. They’re terribly forlorn and lonely.
And then the girls, and the miserable little
children&mdash;&mdash;Oh, it’s a paradise compared to
our mills in the South, of course, but&mdash;I’m
afraid I’m boring you. Perhaps you aren’t
interested in such things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am,” Betty told him earnestly,
“only I don’t know very much about them.
Are you&mdash;do you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I try to see that the workers are all safer
and happier,” he helped her out. “It’s very
hard to accomplish much. The manager
thinks I’m crazy, and the workers won’t trust
me because I’m my father’s son. It’s my
father’s mill, you understand. If I plan a
dance or a concert they think it’s some new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>kind of trap to lower wages or get in non-union
workers, or to make them buy a lot of
new clothes at the Company’s store.” He
smiled sadly at Betty. “I suppose the tea-room
business isn’t all roses, but I can tell
you it looks like long-stemmed American
beauties compared to my job. I must be
off. Next time it will be your turn to
grumble.”</p>

<p>But when the hour of Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
struck the next day, Betty had a
friend beside her desk&mdash;Babbie Hildreth, just
arrived in response to a despairing summons
from Betty, who had found the keeping up of
the gift-shop department through the Christmas
rush, with Mary off to hear Dr. Hinsdale
read his famous paper, Madeline tired and
worried over her neglected stories, and the
college girl helpers overwhelmed with end-of-the-term
papers and festivities, a good deal
more than she could manage.</p>

<p>“Of course we oughtn’t to stop now,” Babbie
agreed eagerly as she listened to Betty’s
account of the situation. “I’m ready to pitch
in day and night. I haven’t had anything
on hand that I absolutely had to do for so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>long that I feel half asleep. Who’s the long-legged
man, Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty explained. “We don’t know his
name,” she concluded, “so Madeline calls
him Young-Man-Over-the-Fence.”</p>

<p>Babbie nodded comprehendingly. “Of
course he can jump fences, but if he couldn’t
he’d get over them all the same&mdash;witness his
chin. He’s got nice eyes and a nice smile,
but I hate a chin like that.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got quite a determined chin yourself,
Babbie Hildreth,” Betty reminded her
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Probably that’s why I hate them for other
people,” Babbie admitted. “Well, I’m going
up to let Madeline set me to work.”</p>

<p>The “nice eyes” of Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
followed her graceful little figure absently,
as she climbed the stairs. He had
dawdled an unprecedented time over his tea,
watching the pretty picture that she and Betty
made, absorbed in their merry, animated
talk.</p>

<p>“Some day I think you might let me go
up-stairs,” he told Betty, as he paid his bill.
“I’ve noticed that all your very nicest customers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
do it. I’m a very regular customer&mdash;if
that counts in any one’s favor.”</p>

<p>“Babbie isn’t a customer,” Betty explained.
“She’s one of the firm. Mrs. Hinsdale is a
customer, but she helps us make things.
The gift-shop workroom is up there, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Well, I’ll help make things too, if
you’ll let me come,” he promised. “You
keep it up evenings, don’t you? I was at
the factory last night, and I saw your
light going up there. I thought seriously of
coming over to protest against your infringing
on the working man’s rule for an eight-hour
day. If I had, would you have let
me in?”</p>

<p>“I presume so,” Betty admitted laughingly,
“because we should have thought it was
Georgia Ames come to say good-night, or
some college girl, who had filled orders for us,
bringing the things.”</p>

<p>Young-Man-Over-the-Fence nodded approvingly.
“Then the next evening that I find
myself perishing of loneliness I shall try it.”
And he rushed for the door so violently that
he almost ran down a pair of little freshmen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>who were chattering too busily about their
senior crushes to look out for human
whirlwinds coming along in the opposite
direction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">AN ORDER FOR A PARTY</span></h2></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I suppose</span> people do sometimes have to be
away from their homes on Christmas day.”
Betty held the “extra-special” shade she had
just finished up against the light, and gazed
pensively at the prancing horses and the hospitable
red roof of the inn.</p>

<p>“It has been done,” gurgled Madeline, her
mouth full of pins, “and it will be done
again, with the Washington Square homestead
rented and Sorrento, Italy, a little inaccessible
from Harding, U. S. A.”</p>

<p>“Poor, lonely lady! Come and eat your
Christmas dinner with mummy and me,”
urged Babbie sympathetically. “Is it Tuesday
or Wednesday that college closes?”</p>

<p>“Not till Wednesday,” murmured Madeline,
“and then it’s me for freedom and the
literary life!” She took the pins out cautiously,
one by one. “It’s dear of you to ask
me for the vacation, Babbie, but I’ve got to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>improve the shining hours. While the tea-room
is shut, and Betty, the cruel slave-driver,
has gone to be clasped in the arms of
her adored and adoring family, I shall turn
our palatial apartment into an author’s paradise&mdash;papers
everywhere, genius burning, and
positively no dusting allowed. If the wallpaper
gets on my nerves I shall come over and
start a fire here, and try the effect of a desk
with a secret drawer in it on the imagination
that Dick Blake rudely says I haven’t got.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Madeline, but I don’t think I
can go home.” Betty was swallowing hard to
keep back the tears. She had thought it all
out in the night, and made up her mind not
to care, but telling it made it seem more final
some way, and consequently worse. “Some
of the orders can’t be filled until the last
minute, and some will surely be late and have
to be mailed. I haven’t made any payments
to outsiders for two weeks, because I couldn’t
take time to go over the accounts. I shouldn’t
enjoy Christmas with all those things hanging
over my head.”</p>

<p>“Then stop making those everlasting candle-shades
and go to work on the accounts this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>very minute,” commanded Babbie, with a tilt
of her determined chin.</p>

<p>“But if I do that,” Betty objected, “we
can’t possibly fill our orders. Besides, I don’t
believe the tea-room ought to be closed during
the vacation. A good many girls stay
over, and anyway it won’t seem businesslike.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it open then,” declared Madeline
magnanimously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you couldn’t ever manage, Madeline.
You’d make a mess&mdash;&mdash;” Betty stopped
short, with a swift effort to be tactful.
“You’d ruin your imagination, I mean,
thinking up new sandwiches and paying
grocer’s bills.”</p>

<p>Babbie and Madeline exchanged despairing
glances.</p>

<p>“I won’t dust our room, Madeline,” Betty
promised, “not once in the whole two weeks,
and you may scatter papers wherever you like.
And you mustn’t think I mind terribly, Babbie.
You’ve got to tend up to things you do
for a living or else&mdash;&mdash; Oh, dear! who is
that knocking?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” Babbie offered, “because I’ve just
washed the paint off my hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>So Babbie Hildreth and not Betty, who
had been sympathetic about lonely evenings,
opened the door for Young-Man-Over-the-Fence,
and after a frigid “Good-evening”
stood frowning in disapproving silence while
she waited for him to explain himself.</p>

<p>“I came to ask&mdash;that is, I wanted to see
about placing an order. I suppose I shouldn’t
have come this evening, only I was in a hurry
to get things settled right away. Is Miss&mdash;the
young woman who sits at the desk&mdash;could
I see her?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” Babbie told him coldly.
“You can’t have dinner here, you know.
This tea-shop closes at six, and it’s nearly
eight now.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“I’m very sorry,” murmured Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
contritely. Babbie Hildreth
in a blue gingham studio apron, with a distractingly
becoming dinner-gown peeping out
from underneath it, was a sight calculated to
inspire contrition in the breast of any man
who had unwittingly incurred her displeasure.
“I’ll come back in the morning&mdash;no, in the
afternoon,” he added humbly.</p>

<p>“If it was an order for Tally-ho candle-shades,”
Babbie told him, still icily, “we’re
not taking any more. We have all the work
that we can finish for Christmas already.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not candle-shades,” Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
assured her blandly. “It’s a
bigger thing than that.” He paused impressively
and was rewarded when a gleam of
curiosity crossed Babbie’s impassive little face.
“I’ll come back to-morrow afternoon,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Babbie commanded
swiftly. Betty had inspired her with a sense
of the importance of being businesslike, and
here was a big order that ought, perhaps, to
be treated with special respect and consideration.
“I’ll tell Miss Wales that you’re here
and possibly she can see you more conveniently
now. The name, please?”</p>

<p>“Robert Thayer, Junior, from the stocking
factory,” he told her. “And say, please, that
I’ve come on business, about a Christmas party
that I want to arrange for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we do catering for parties,”
Babbie told him, “and I believe we are to
close for the Christmas holidays. But I’ll
tell her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>A minute later Betty was shaking hands
with Young-Man-Over-the-Fence, alias Mr.
Robert Thayer, Junior, of the stocking
factory.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky I didn’t just cut in here to be
cheered up, as I’d intended to,” he explained
with a sigh of relief. “That other member
of the firm is a suspicious person&mdash;or perhaps
you’d warned her against me. But her
theories were unfounded. May we sit down?
You see I’ve had an inspiration, and I couldn’t
wait to get it going.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like Madeline,” laughed Betty.
“She wakes me up in the middle of the night
with her inspirations. Once she even wanted
me to dress and come over here with her to
see whether we could make a big horseshoe
out of oats.” Betty pointed to the one over
the fireplace. “And then when I wouldn’t,
she was days and days getting around to it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer laughed appreciatively. “I
understand that perfectly. There’s everything
in being in the right mood for things.
Now to-night I’m hot on the trail of a Christmas
party. I was over in my office directing
invitations&mdash;they like to get formal invitations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
you know&mdash;when it suddenly struck
me that if I had a regulation Christmas party
it would naturally be a regulation failure, like
the others I’ve tried. So I racked my brains
for something extraordinary, and nothing
came. Then I looked over here and thought
of all the extraordinary things you’ve planned,
and here I am to place an order for one extraordinary
party, with food, all guaranteed
to please three hundred assorted factory
hands.”</p>

<p>Betty stared at him in amazement. “I
don’t understand&mdash;&mdash;” she began.</p>

<p>Young-Man-Over-the-Fence smiled his
merry, reassuring smile. “As your tea-shop
is to the regulation kind of tea-shop, so is the
Christmas party I want to the regular thing.
I want it to look something like this room, to
be&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stunty,” supplied Betty quickly.</p>

<p>“Stunty&mdash;that’s a new one on me, but if it
describes all this&mdash;&mdash;” He waved his hand
comprehensively at the fire, at a grinning
gargoyle with its hanging lantern, and across
to the dusky line of stalls.</p>

<p>“Features, Madeline calls the queer little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>touches,” Betty broke in again. “I understand
what you want. You want a party in
Harding style,&mdash;that will go off the way the
spreads and Hallowe’en things and freshmen
frolics do. Madeline could think up something
lovely. But I don’t see&mdash;how did you
happen to come to us?”</p>

<p>“Because I felt sure you could get me what
I wanted.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t do things like that,” Betty
objected.</p>

<p>“Then you ought to,” he told her. “There’s
a field for it.” He laughed merrily. “I’m
the field. And&mdash;I dislike to mention anything
so sordid, but it pays very well, much
better than tea and candle-shades, I’m sure.
In London once I remember my sister paid
twenty pounds to a firm for planning her a
cotillion. I’d thought that would be about
right for this party.”</p>

<p>“Twenty pounds&mdash;why, that’s a hundred
dollars!” cried Betty incredulously.</p>

<p>The young man nodded. “That doesn’t
include the refreshments, you understand.
It’s for the design only&mdash;the design for a
stunty party with features. And then think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>of all the pleasure you’ll be giving. But&mdash;I
forgot; the young lady who let me in said
you were going to close your shop for Christmas.
Perhaps that means that you won’t be
here to run a party on Christmas eve.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled sadly. “We were just discussing
that and we’ve decided&mdash;at least, I’ve
decided, to keep open during the holidays.
But we’re very busy.” She considered,
frowning. “It all depends on whether Madeline
likes the idea,” she decided at last. “I’ll
call her down, and you can tell her about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait one minute,” he begged, as Betty
started off. “Tell me how to make her like
it, please. Is she the one who let me in?”</p>

<p>“No,” Betty told him, “but of course Babbie
will have to approve too.” She stopped
to consider again. “I’d tell you how to
make Madeline like it if I knew myself, but I
don’t. It just depends on how a thing strikes
her.”</p>

<p>But when Madeline and Babbie appeared,
Betty did help by breaking the ice, for she
gravely presented “Mr. Fence” to the other
members of the firm, whereupon Madeline
promptly told him about his pseudonym at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>the Tally-ho, and then, rather abashed by her
own temerity, lit the candles in the stalls to
show him how she had named them that very
evening, according to his suggestion.</p>

<p>So they were all, except Babbie, very
friendly, when they sat down again to discuss
Mr. Thayer’s order; and Mr. Thayer seemed
to have decided that it was safest to ignore
Babbie, for he addressed himself entirely to
Madeline, as he explained again what he
wanted.</p>

<p>And of course, because it was absurd and
unexpected, Madeline liked the idea. She
forgot how busy they were already, and how
she hated conducting rehearsals and working
out details. She threw her Literary Career to
the winds.</p>

<p>“You want it on Christmas eve?” she began
briskly. “Then we’ll have a masque of
the Christmas stockings to start off with.
Isn’t that an appropriate touch for the stocking-makers’
Christmas party? How old are
your youngest stocking-makers, please?”</p>

<p>“They say they’re fourteen, as the law requires,”
explained Mr. Thayer grimly, “but
you’d never know it. Anyhow they’re small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>enough to do beautifully for a masque of the
Christmas stockings.”</p>

<p>“And then,” Madeline went on, staring
hard at the shiny tip of Babbie’s slipper, “and
then&mdash;well, Twelfth Night isn’t till the sixth
of January, but probably the stocking-makers
won’t object to anticipating the date a little.
We’ll have a pageant of Twelfth Night cakes
and Twelfth Night bakers. And we’ll choose
and crown a King and Queen of the Revels,
in accepted Twelfth Night style. Does that
sound promising to you, Mr. Thayer?”</p>

<p>“It sounds great,” he assured her enthusiastically,
“and I’m sure it will be as good
as it sounds.”</p>

<p>“The invitation card,” Madeline ordered
calmly, “is to have a beautifully frosted cake
at the top and a stocking with a Santa Claus
head sticking out of it at the bottom. You’ll
just have to throw away the ones you got
ready to-night. I’ll come around some time
to-morrow to look over my children.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That will be great,” said
Mr. Thayer eagerly, and suddenly turned to
Babbie, who had listened in silence to all
Madeline’s enthusiastic planning. “Won’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>you please come too? It’s a queer place. I
think you’d like going through it.”</p>

<p>“I shall probably have to come,” Babbie
told him rather ungraciously, “because Madeline
can’t go alone, and Betty will be too busy.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that I should be the means of
inconveniencing you,” Mr. Thayer told her
gravely, holding out his hand. “Good-night.”
And he was gone, with only a nod for the
others.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Babbie, but you’re chilly,”
Madeline protested.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re absurd,” Babbie retorted.
“You can never make such a thing go in the
world, Madeline. That sort of people won’t
know how to carry it through.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Madeline conceded. “I’ve
thought of that. Some of the children will
do for Stockings, but for the Cakes and the
Jester and all that, I’m going to have college
girls who stay here over the holidays. I
think I’ll go up now to see Georgia about
who’ll be here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a splendid idea!” cried Betty
eagerly. “I’d been wishing we could make a
Christmas for the left-overs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ll want to bother with
anything like this,” objected Babbie. “Besides,
only freaks stay over Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” Madeline took her up. “They’ll
jump at it&mdash;the freaks particularly, because
they don’t get in on such gay doings very
often. Now, Betty, don’t you worry about my
helping on the ‘extra-special’ order-list. I
was afraid Mr. Thayer would be scared off if
I explained that I meant to dump all the
finishing touches on the left-over girls. They
can make the costumes, too, Wednesday night
and Thursday.”</p>

<p>“If he knew you better, he would have been
sure that you’d never bother with any finishing
touches yourself,” Babbie remarked crushingly.</p>

<p>“How can you expect a person who has
such splendid ideas to bother with fussy little
details?” put in Betty, who had listened in
wondering admiration to Madeline’s offhand
suggestions. “I’m sure the college girls will
like to help. The only trouble is, if they do
most of the work who ought to have the hundred
dollars?”</p>

<p>“What hundred dollars?” chorused the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>other two, and Betty explained that the
financial side of the Tally-ho’s biggest order
was being entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>“It ought not to be put in with the tea-room
profits, except the bill for the refreshments,”
Babbie declared, “and I certainly
ought not to have any of it. I shan’t be any
help. You and Madeline can divide, because
you made friends with him first, and she
thought up the entertainment.”</p>

<p>“But if the others sew for us&mdash;&mdash;” began
Betty.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s wait and see how it comes out,”
Madeline suggested easily, slipping on her
ulster. “You two can be planning Twelfth
Night cakes for refreshments, while I’m gone.
Did you ever see them in London, Babbie?
They’re fearfully and wonderfully concocted.”</p>

<p>At the door she came back to make another
suggestion.  “All big businesses have
their pet charities. We might have the
stocking people for ours. We could just ask
Mr. Thayer to pay the expenses, and make
him spend the rest of the money for a club-house&mdash;well,
keep it toward a club-house
then, Miss Betty the practical.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Next morning Madeline came back from
her visit to the factory more enthusiastic, if
possible, than before. She had talked to the
Italian boy with the bandaged arm&mdash;he came
down every day to have it dressed by the
company’s doctor&mdash;and he was from Sorrento
and knew her father, had posed for him once
in the olive orchard behind the villa. Even
Babbie had been interested in the children,
Italians, French, Poles, Bohemians, Greeks,
dark-eyed, swift-fingered, chattering eagerly
to “da pretta lada” in broken English, and
all agog over the mysterious Christmas party.</p>

<p>“They live all together down there somewhere.”
Babbie pointed vaguely off behind
the kitchen. “They were nearly all brought
over to this country three years ago, when the
factory was opened. It’s a real foreign
quarter, Mr. Thayer says, with old-country
customs and pitiful poverty and ignorance.
It’s queer that we never knew anything about
them, isn’t it? The college is on that hill,
and the factory on this, and yet they’re so far
apart that one has hardly heard of the other.”</p>

<p>“So the stocking people weren’t so terribly
unpleasant after all?” asked Betty slyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Babbie blushed faintly. “Well, you and
Madeline made me cross. You gave in so to
his chin. I suppose I was disagreeable, but I
was perfect to-day, wasn’t I, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“Depends on what you mean by perfect,”
Madeline told her. “If you mean that you
made everybody in the place from the social
secretary, or whatever Mr. Robert Thayer,
Junior, calls himself, to the smallest cotton-spinner
of them all fall madly in l&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Madeline and the rest of her sentence found
themselves smothered under a huge cushion,
which Babbie pummeled viciously.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother me about that,” she commanded
wrathfully. “One minute you say
I’m haughty and disagreeable, and the
next&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The next,” Betty told her comfortingly,
“we only say you’re such a darling, that people
can’t help seeing it, you silly child.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” sniffed Babbie tearfully.
“I shan’t go over there again, and I shan’t be
here for his old party. So now!”</p>

<p>After which declaration of rights, Babbie did
her hair low in her neck, donned her most
becoming afternoon dress, and asked a dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>adoring freshmen to tea with her in the stall
named “Jack o’ Hearts.” As Babbie sat in
the most secluded corner of the stall, it is
doubtful if anything but the tip of her ear, a
nodding plume, and an absurdly small hand
stretched out to press more of Cousin Kate’s
cookies upon a hungry freshman, could have
been visible to the staid young gentleman
who had his tea at a small table in the alcove
opposite.</p>

<p>“He’s the new history professor,” one of
the freshmen announced in a sepulchral
whisper. “Isn’t he handsome?”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t,” snapped Babbie. “Isn’t
the new history professor, I mean. He’s
something or other in a factory. So don’t be
making plans to move into a history course
after midyears, Susanna.”</p>

<span class="smaller">UNEXPECTED VISITORS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeline</span> composed the Masque of the
Christmas Stockings in the first frenzy of her
enthusiasm, and then, declaring that genius
wouldn’t burn any more, she left the Pageant
of Twelfth Night Cakes until so late that
Betty was in despair; and she persistently
forgot the Christmas Stockings’ rehearsals until
Babbie, rallying to the honor of the
Tally-ho, took them in charge.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish you were going to stay for
the party?” Mr. Thayer asked her, at her last
rehearsal, while Madeline, who had come to
take over the reins again, was giving her final
directions to the children. In the intervals
of the rehearsal, she had scribbled off some
songs and speeches for the Cakes, which were
so clever that Babbie had been compelled to
drop what Madeline had wickedly dubbed her
Perfect Manner and laugh heartily over them,
as she and Mr. Thayer read them together.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Her Perfect Manner was quite different from
the one that she had hastily called perfect on
the day of her first visit to the stocking factory.
Madeline had written the other B’s
about it, describing it deftly as “Sweetness
from a Long Way off.”</p>

<p>So now Babbie answered with distant courtesy,
“Of course I’m very much interested in
the party, but I shouldn’t think of not going
home for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly not,” Mr. Thayer agreed
hastily. “I shouldn’t either, only I haven’t
been sufficiently urged. I had a letter from
my father yesterday saying that the laws I
got passed last month by the state legislature
were going to ruin him, so now I’m not even
expecting a present.”</p>

<p>“Why do you go to work and have laws
passed that your father doesn’t like?” inquired
Babbie severely.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want me to have any passed
that could possibly please him, would you?”
Mr. Thayer retorted, and when he caught the
flicker of interest in Babbie’s eyes he went on,
“You see, Miss Hildreth, my father has the
wrong point of view. He always thinks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>the dollars, where he ought to think of the
workers. He holds to the old-fashioned theory
that the man who toils hasn’t any feelings.
He’s never seen any of his factories. He sits
in an office in New York, at a shiny mahogany
desk with twenty nice little pigeonholes in it,
one for each of his factories. When a manager’s
report shows fat profits, he smiles and
tucks it into its pigeon-hole. If the profits go
down, he sends for the manager&mdash;or bounces
him without sending for him. When I left
college he gave me a pigeon-hole.”</p>

<p>“This factory, you mean?” asked Babbie.</p>

<p>“Not at first. He’s changed my pigeon-hole
several times. First he gave me a mill
in South Carolina, and I went down and
wrote about the appalling conditions there for
one of the prominent magazines.”</p>

<p>“That was rather unkind of you, wasn’t it,”
Babbie demanded, “when he’d just given you
the factory?”</p>

<p>The young man smiled. “My father
thought it was, but I maintained that I could
do as I pleased with my own property. Anyhow
he took back his little gift and sent me
to a beet-sugar plant out in Michigan, and told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>me to see if I could keep out of mischief there.
Well, the railroads were all giving us special
freight rates, and we were fairly coining
money and crushing all our competitors to
the wall. I told them they must play fair,
or I’d expose them. My father was furious,&mdash;but
I think he was just a little proud too,
to find that I couldn’t be taken in. So we
had a big pow-wow about the duty of sons
and fair play in business, and he finally agreed
to give me a free hand here, at the least profitable
factory he owns. Whatever profits there
are I am to have to improve conditions with,
and I can take as long as I like to show my
father that it pays to treat your men like human
beings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see the use of fussing so much to
prove that,” Babbie told him coldly. “If
they don’t like working for him, they can
leave, can’t they?”</p>

<p>“If they enjoy starving they can,” Mr.
Thayer told her grimly. Then he smiled the
smile that Babbie always warmed to in spite
of herself. “You’re a capitalist and an employer
yourself, Miss Hildreth. If you have
such mistaken ideas on the labor question, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>think I ought to stop patronizing your firm.
You may be abusing the cook.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she is overworked days when
there’s a rush,” Babbie admitted soberly.
“But if she says she’s tired, we always send
her home in a carriage, and she calls us all
‘me darlin’.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer threw back his head and
laughed. “Then I can certainly patronize
you with a clear conscience. I’m so relieved.
It would be terrible to have to call off the
Christmas party.”</p>

<p>It would indeed have been tragic to call off
the Christmas party, with three hundred
eager factory hands, not to mention twenty-five
homesick college girls, looking forward
to it as the great event of the holiday season.
The whole college had heard about it, and
took a deep and envious interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p>“Just mean of you to give it when I can’t
come,” grumbled Georgia.</p>

<p>“Madeline, let us repeat the Pageant of the
Twelfth Night Cakes for Dramatic Club’s
January meeting,” begged Polly Eastman.</p>

<p>“Make him have another party when we’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>here,” put in the fluffy-haired Dutton twin.
“It’s hateful of you to keep him all to yourselves.”</p>

<p>College closed at noon on Wednesday, and
lunch hour at the Tally-ho was a pell-mell
rush of happy, hungry girls, loaded down
with suit-cases, running out between courses
to look for “that dastardly cabman who said
he never in his life was late,” or hailing a
passing car with a frantic wave of a sandwich
wrapped in a paper napkin. “And it’s all
I’ll get till eight to-night,” they assured Betty
joyously, for lunch is a small thing when
you’re going home for Christmas. Betty reveled
in the rush and the gay confusion.
She helped little Ruth Howard spirit Lucile
Merrifield’s suit-case into a secluded corner to
tuck in a mysterious little package tied with
holly ribbon. She took orders for belated
gifts, repacked bags that simply wouldn’t
hold their owner’s left-over note-books and
last purchases until she took them in hand.
She looked up trains, promised to forward
trunk checks that hadn’t come in time, and
was here, there, and everywhere until, when
she heard the far-away whistle of the two-fifteen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
she gave a little sigh of relief and declared
that she felt like the distracted centipede
in the nonsense rhyme.</p>

<p>And then a dismal quiet descended on the
Tally-ho Tea-Shop. Madeline was up-stairs
with a bevy of Cakes, who were rehearsing
and working on their costumes. Betty refused
to join them until she had straightened
out her accounts; she had a horror of being
behind with them. So she was sitting quite
alone working busily, when Eugenia Ford
came in. Eugenia’s pretty face was tear-stained,
her eyes were swollen half shut, and
her whole appearance was as limp and woebegone
as it usually was alert and aggressive.
She hesitated for a minute, and then crossed
quickly to Betty’s desk.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Miss Ford,” Betty said
cheerfully, tactfully ignoring the tear-stains,
and then she waited, not knowing how to go
on.</p>

<p>But Eugenia only nodded and stared at her
in dumb misery, evidently afraid to speak
lest the tears should start again.</p>

<p>So, “Won’t you sit down?” Betty suggested
cordially. “Or did you want to go up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>and see Madeline and the Cakes? They’re
behind the curtains in the loft, rehearsing.”</p>

<p>Eugenia dropped into a chair. “I’m not
going home for Christmas,” she announced
tremulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t you?” Betty began comfortingly.
“Well, then you must certainly have
a part in the Masque of the Cakes. You’d
make a lovely Sugar Cooky, and I heard
Madeline say they needed more.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I look like&mdash;a fr-fright,” choked
Eugenia, stifling a sob, “if that’s how a sugar
cooky looks, and I don’t want to see anybody
b-but you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Betty assured her hastily,
“then you shan’t. There won’t be a soul in
here now for a while. Please don’t feel so unhappy,
but tell me what I can do to help you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been warned in three different
studies.” Eugenia’s voice was weighted with
the tragic significance of her words. “And I
th-thought I was doing beautifully,” she
added, while two big tears rolled slowly down
her soft cheeks. Eugenia dabbed at them
with a very damp handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” cried Betty sympathetically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
racking her brains, meanwhile, to think
why in the world Eugenia Ford had come to
her with her tale of woe. “It’s the worst
thing about freshman year, I think&mdash;the not
being able to tell how you’ve done, nor what
the teachers expect of you. I worried fearfully,
I remember.”</p>

<p>“Were you warned too?” demanded Eugenia
with the frankness of despair.</p>

<p>“N-no.” Betty was really sorry at the
moment that she hadn’t been. “But lots of
my friends were,” she added consolingly.</p>

<p>“My father and mother think I ought to
have known that I wasn’t studying enough,”
Eugenia explained. “You see, I didn’t pass
my prep. school exams one year and my father
thought that was perfectly dreadful, so
he’s extra cross now. I had to write home
about it, because of all the money I shall
need for a tutor, and when I did that, my
father said I should stay on here through the
vacation and w-work.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard now not to go home, but you’ll
be glad you didn’t next term, I guess,” Betty
suggested. “The time just flies, from the day
college opens again to midyears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” continued Eugenia gloomily, “then
my tutor changed her mind at the last minute
and went off and left me, and Miss Ferris&mdash;she’s
our class officer&mdash;told me to come to you.
I said I didn’t think you ever tutored, but
she said to come all the same and she sent you
a note. Oh, I ought to have given you the
note first!” A big tear splashed down on the
address, as she handed Miss Ferris’s note to
Betty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear little helper,” Miss Ferris had
written, “here’s a chance for you to cultivate
the right kind of college spirit. That’s what
Miss Ford needs. She seems bright enough
to keep up with her class easily. You must
inspire her with pride in her work and determination
to do it justice. I needn’t tell
you that she’s a dreadful little snob. Some
day you must tell me why she begged me most
pathetically to send her to anybody else but you.</p>

<p class="right3">“Merry Christmas,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Margaret Ferris</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Betty read it all through twice, while
Eugenia, huddled in a forlorn little heap,
watched her eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I just can’t,” she began at last.
“Miss Ferris has forgotten what a stupid I
was. And if you should be&mdash;&mdash;” She had
started to say “flunked out at midyears,” and
paused in blank dismay at her own thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I won’t,” Eugenia took her up
earnestly, reading Betty’s thoughts in the
light of her own guilty conscience. “I
promise I won’t be horrid. I was&mdash;the other
day&mdash;I was&mdash;well, I’m awfully ashamed of it
now, Miss Wales, and I just hated to come
and ask a favor of you, after having been so
disagreeable, but I couldn’t actually disobey
Miss Ferris, could I? If you’ll only take me,
I’ll do just as you say, and work awfully
hard, and try not to be much bother.”</p>

<p>Betty gave a deep sigh, and then a comical
little laugh. “I’m sure you will,” she said.
“And I shall have to do it. Don’t you see I
shall? Miss Ferris has gone away for the
vacation, hasn’t she? Well, I can’t disobey
her either, or disappoint her. But just imagine
me tutoring anybody!” Betty sighed
again resignedly.</p>

<p>“Miss Ferris said you’d be the best one she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>could possibly pick out for me,” Eugenia told
her, smiling wanly through her tears. “When
shall I come, so as to be the least trouble, Miss
Wales?”</p>

<p>They arranged an hour, and then Betty
asked Eugenia, as a great favor, to help her
make tea for Madeline and the Cakes, because
Bridget and Nora had both gone to a wedding,
and their long talk had made her late with
the preparations. And by the time the sandwiches
were made, the lemons sliced, and the
tea served, Eugenia’s face looked merely interestingly
pale and care-worn, and she was
planning her Sugar Cooky costume with
positive enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Thayer’s party was a grand
success. Had any party of Madeline’s planning
ever been otherwise? First the little
Stockings hopped merrily on to the stage that
Mr. Thayer had had built at one end of the
big social hall on the top floor of the factory.
Hopping was their only means of locomotion,
for each of them was tied securely into a
mammoth stocking, its toe stuffed with paper
to give it the proper shape, and its top gathered
around the neck of its small occupant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>whose head peered inquiringly out above.
There was a Mother-Stocking, a Father-Stocking,
a Good-Little-Willy-Stocking, and a Bad-Little-Billy
one; there was a fireplace, and a
Santa Claus, who, being a jolly fellow, relented
even toward Bad-Little-Billy, and
loaded the whole family with comical gifts&mdash;for
in Stocking Land Santa Claus is not the
mysterious, secretive apparition we know of,
but a friendly visitor, who slaps you familiarly
on the back and lets you come up the chimney
and pat the reindeer. The frantic race of
Billy and Willy Stocking to get up the chimney
with their costumes intact ended the
Stockings’ performance, and left the audience
tearful with mirth.</p>

<p>Then the Cakes appeared. Sponge Cake
led the procession, in a corn-colored gown
trimmed elaborately with fringes of tiny
sponges. She wore a festoon of sponges in
her hair, and carried before her a sort of baton
with the biggest sponge you could imagine
stuck on the end of it. After her came Chocolate
Cake, with ruffles of brown and white,
and a necklace and bracelets made of chocolate
candies. Next came Bride’s Cake, all in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>white, with a veil and orange blossoms, and
Wedding Cake, with garlands of raisins, and
wedding bells that tinkled when she moved.
Devil’s Cake, adorned with all the little red
devils that could be found on the Harding
campus&mdash;relics of a fad that had prevailed in
Betty’s senior year&mdash;drove a regiment of Sugar
Cookies before her&mdash;yellow-haired girls, each
carrying a huge cooky, whose framework was
a hoop, plentifully besprinkled with a glittering
sugary paste. Last of all came the Doughnuts,
very big and beautifully browned, worn
like life-preservers around the shoulders of
their representatives. The Cakes sang and
discussed their respective merits. The Sugar
Cookies, being challenged to show what they
could do, had a hoop-rolling, in the course of
which all the sugar fell off them. Then the
Twelfth Night Bakers came in, in white caps
and long white aprons, and the Sugar Cookies,
no longer sugared, reproached their makers,
and were placated with wonderful new
Twelfth Night decorations in the shape of
toys, birds, and flowers.</p>

<p>Finally the Bakers produced a huge cake,
and, served by the plebeian Doughnuts, sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>down to eat it. Hidden in it were a bean,
a pea, and a clove, and the three Bakers who
were lucky enough to find these Twelfth
Night emblems in their portions of cake
had the privilege of naming the King and
Queen of Revels, and the Twelfth Night
Jester.</p>

<p>The King and Queen had really been
chosen beforehand from the mill hands, and
they had nothing to do but sit on gilt thrones
and look imposing, while the Jester, a queer
freshman who was wonderful at sleight-of-hand
tricks, gave a performance in which
cakes and stockings replaced the conventional
rabbits and eggs.</p>

<p>It was all absurd and inconsequent and certainly
quite different from the usual mill
party, even to the way the refreshments were
served, for the Cakes moved about among
the audience carrying trays of ices, and the
Bakers peddled their wares in the shape of
little cup-cakes whose fantastic decorations
rivaled those of the live Cakes in variety and
grotesqueness.</p>

<p>“Shure an’ they ain’t fit fur civilized humans
to ate at all,” Bridget had announced, as she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>surveyed them indignantly, “an’ it’s a shamefu’
waste of good material, not countin’ me
slavin’ two days solid on ’em.”</p>

<p>But Betty had consoled her with explanations
about the “foreignness” of the mill people,
and their consequent love for queer
things. Betty felt capable of consoling anybody
that day. She fairly danced as she
packed the cakes on the afternoon of the
party, and her infectious gaiety in the evening
was one of the best reasons why everything
went off so well.</p>

<p>“It has been just lovely, girls,” she said to the
group of Cakes who crowded around her begging
her to tell them how they looked and whether
they had done their dance well. “Those little
Italian girls in the front row told me they
never knew a party could be so beautiful, and
their mothers almost cried when they thanked
Mr. Thayer. We’ve had lots of fun ourselves,
but the best of it is that we’ve given them a
good time they’ll remember as long as they
live.”</p>

<p>But Betty had a special reason for feeling
happy. For two letters had come in her
morning mail. The one she opened first was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>directed in the smallest sister’s round, painstaking
hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Darlingest Betty,” she began, “mother
says I may come to see you. She said I could
go to see Nan. I love Nan, but I am your
compiny. A person who is compiny always
comes to see you. I will be a good girl and always
run away when you are busy.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span>”</p></div>

<p>“The dear little midget,” laughed Betty,
and tossed the letter to Madeline. “She
wanted to help with the tea-room, so Will told
her she could be a silent partner&mdash;the company
in the firm. And now she wants to
come and see me because she’s my ‘compiny.’”</p>

<p>“She says she is coming,” Madeline corrected her.
“Is that her own idea, or is she
really going to make us a visit?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Betty was deep in her
mother’s letter. “Why&mdash;oh, dear! Father is
going away off to Mexico, and he’s going to
take mother with him! He may have to stay
all the rest of the winter. It’s some land he’s
going to see about, and he hates to go alone.
He and mother are such old lovers! oh, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>he hasn’t been very well, and he hates to go
alone, and mother can’t bear to have him.
He says that her fare now will cost less than a
doctor later, and she can just as well board
down there as in Cleveland, if I can manage
Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can, can’t you?” inquired
Madeline placidly.</p>

<p>“I can, can I?” Betty’s eyes sparkled.
“It’s plain, Madeline Ayres, that you’re an
only child. You haven’t the least idea how it
feels to get a letter like this from that cute
youngster. Mother says they tried to make
her go to Nan’s school, but she wouldn’t come
to any one but me. Can I manage? I can
manage anything with a dear little sister to
play with. Oh, Madeline, I’ve been homesick,
and I never knew it till now!”</p>

<p>“That’s a good brand of homesickness to
cultivate,” laughed Madeline. “She’ll have
to go to school here, won’t she?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “Mother says she can go to
the public schools in a nice little town like
this, but I shan’t have her. I’ve saved lots
out of my salary and my share of the gift-room
profits, and I shall pay her tuition at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>Miss Dick’s. She can prepare for college
thoroughly there. And some day, if we keep
on having such good luck at the Tally-ho, I
can help put her through Harding. Won’t
that be perfectly splendid, Madeline Ayres?”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ADVENT OF THE PLOSHKIN</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you are busy enough, you usually don’t
discover that you are homesick&mdash;especially if,
whenever you do take time to think of your
own private affairs, you can run to the
calendar to count the days before the coming
of the smallest sister. And between work
and fun, Betty and Madeline were very busy
indeed.</p>

<p>First there was Christmas dinner at Mary’s&mdash;as
gay and lively as all Mary’s hospitalities.
Next day there was a select lunch party at the
Tally-ho, at which Mary was the only guest,
and at the end of which, with much pomp
and ceremony, she was officially designated
the One and Only Perfect Patron, and initiated
with the rite of the Secret Drawer.</p>

<p>“You’re not opening that the way you did
before, Madeline,” Betty declared, as the three
bent their heads together over the desk, while
Madeline pressed one after another of the tiny,
hidden springs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am,” Madeline assured her.
“There couldn’t be but one way to open it.
First you press this spring and take out this
drawer; then you press another spring in the
side wall, and out flies your secret compartment.”</p>

<p>“You did at least two more things before,”
insisted Betty.</p>

<p>“Well, the woman I bought the desk of
thought one push would do it all,” Madeline
reminded her. “Before long we may discover
the one magic touch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” sighed Mary rapturously.
“I like to have it complicated, so that you
forget exactly how it goes between times, and
have to fuss and fumble around. Now please
shut it and let me find it again all by myself.”</p>

<p>“No, that is the second rite,” Madeline told
her severely. “Come back in a week, a day,
and an hour. Meditate, meanwhile, on the
Rules for the Perfect Patron, and concoct at
least one beautiful new feature for the tea-shop.
Then, and not till then, are you permitted
to touch these mystic springs. For to-day
all is finished, and your long-suffering
husband is waiting sadly for his tea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Though it was vacation time, the Tally-ho
Tea-Shop found plenty of patrons. Besides
Mr. Thayer, there were all the left-over girls,
who, having discovered that they could have
a good time if they kept together, organized
breakfast and lunch parties and afternoon tea-drinkings,
with skating, snow-shoeing, and
sliding expeditions for appetizers between
times. Betty and Eugenia had to seek the
privacy of the loft for their lessons, while
Madeline spread her Literary Career, in the
shape of a heterogeneous litter of half-finished
stories, over Betty’s desk, and good-naturedly
combined the duties of cashier and manager
with the toils of authorship. The best thing
about a Literary Career, she confided to Mr.
Thayer, when he came in one day for his tea,
is that you can pursue it in any reasonably
quiet corner.</p>

<p>“Who publishes your things?” Mr. Thayer
inquired interestedly. “I must read them.”</p>

<p>And Madeline was forced to admit that so
far she had no publishers. “But I’m going
to keep on till I do,” she declared hopefully.
“I could learn to paint easier, I know, because
that runs in the family, but I don’t want to.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>I’m bound to write, and I’ll keep at it until I
succeed.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll back you to make a big hit,”
Mr. Thayer declared solemnly. “Anybody
that could write those Cake songs, and that
Stocking Act&mdash;&mdash; By the way, please ask
the real cashier to send me a bill for my
party.”</p>

<p>Madeline promised, and wasted the next
hour considering whether she should spend
her share of the December profits for a trip to
Bohemia, New York, or a set of Dickens in
morocco bindings. The worst thing about a
Literary Career is the ease with which one’s
mind wanders away from it.</p>

<p>Eugenia Ford cheered up a little over the
Pageant of the Cakes, but when that was done
with she relapsed into her former state of
tearful melancholy. She was too busy to join
in the fun the other girls were having, and
besides, as she explained carefully to Betty,
they weren’t any of them in her crowd. Betty
received this statement in discreet silence.
She believed in taking things one at a time,
and Eugenia’s complete ignorance of the history
of early English literature, her hopeless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>wonder at the intricacies of geometrical
figures, and her perfectly appalling ideas
about the principles of exposition, as exhibited
in her themes, were certainly all that
could be attended to in a two weeks’ vacation.
Betty had been “good” in solid geometry;
she could glean the main facts of the literary
history from the text-book and the notes that
Eugenia had thoughtfully borrowed from a
friend who was a “Lit. shark”; the themes
she could easily see were poor enough to secure
their author a warning, but what the
exact trouble was she could not tell.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I could do any better myself,”
Betty confided to Madeline. “Please
tell me what to tell her.”</p>

<p>Madeline read through a few of Eugenia’s
stupid little efforts, and called Betty’s attention
to the marks in blue pencil at the end.</p>

<p>“‘No sequence of thought, no progressive
logic, no relevant detail.’ That’s the trouble
with them all. ‘Poor paragraphing; no development
of the central idea.’ Her instructor
gave her plenty of hints, but she blissfully
ignored them all.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t understand them, I suppose,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>Betty defended Eugenia. “Anyway I don’t,
and you’ve got to explain till I do, Madeline
Ayres. I’m sorry to bother so, but I’ve got
her on my hands, and she shan’t be flunked
in composition if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Madeline. “Now
just what is it that you don’t understand?”</p>

<p>At the end of an hour’s careful explanation
Betty declared that she thought she could
coach Eugenia in theme-work. “You might
have explained straight to her instead of to
me,” she added, “only she cries such a lot.
It’s awfully embarrassing, until you get used
to it, to have to talk to a fountain.”</p>

<p>But if Eugenia wept copiously, she listened
attentively, and worked hard, and gradually
both she and Betty were conscious that their
efforts were telling. Betty was more relieved,
if possible, than Eugenia.</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly improved a heap in
geometry,” she told her pupil, toward the
end of the second week. “And you know
that table of dates in ‘Lit.,’ and your themes
are a speck better. Your regular tutor will
have to put most of her time on those.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“My regular tutor!” Eugenia’s tone was
terror-stricken. “Oh, Miss Wales, I want to
keep on with you, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t want anything of the kind,”
Betty assured her emphatically. “I was
second choice, remember, and besides, I don’t
do tutoring. I only did it through vacation
to oblige you and Miss Ferris, but just as soon
as she gets back and the tutor, and&mdash;&mdash;” Betty
paused. Eugenia had not cried for three
days, but now she was winking hard. “Well,
we’ll talk it over with Miss Ferris,” Betty told
her hastily. “I really must go now. I’ve
got to take the two-fifteen to the Junction to
meet my little sister.”</p>

<p>Eugenia’s face softened and brightened
suddenly. “Is she really little?” she demanded.
“Because I had&mdash;I mean I love
little girls.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s really little,” Betty laughed.
“She’s eleven and very small for her age.”</p>

<p>“Mine would have been&mdash;&mdash;” began Eugenia,
and stopped again, the soft, sweet look
still in her eyes.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t care to come and meet her
too?” Betty asked hesitatingly. “Madeline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>was going with me, but some girls have engaged
tea here, so she’s staying to see to it.”</p>

<p>“I should perfectly love to,” declared Eugenia
enthusiastically. “I’ll be company for
you on the way down, but on the way back
I’ll sit in another seat and&mdash;and do theme
outlines. It’s lovely of you to ask me, Miss
Wales.”</p>

<p>But Eugenia did no theme outlines that
afternoon. The smallest sister was a very
friendly little person. She flew into Betty’s
arms&mdash;Will, who had brought her, was going
straight to Boston on business for Cousin Joe&mdash;and
having hugged and been hugged “’most
to pieces” she turned to Eugenia, held up her
face for a kiss, and snuggled confidingly up to
her new friend while Betty went to see about
the baggage, and later sat in the car with one
arm around Betty and the other around Eugenia.</p>

<p>Eugenia smiled rapturously at Betty. “It
feels so good. You see I had a little sister,
Miss Wales, and she&mdash;I miss her every day of
my life. May I please come and play with
yours sometimes?”</p>

<p>Betty assured her that she might come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>whenever she pleased, smiling to herself as
she remembered how she had meant to warn
little Dorothy that girls like Eugenia Ford
were too busy to bother with smallest
sisters.</p>

<p>It seemed as if nobody was too busy to
amuse Dorothy. Miss Dick’s school did not
open until a week after Harding, and by
that time the smallest sister had become a
regular&mdash;if very restless&mdash;feature of the Tally-ho
Tea-Shop. Polly and Georgia and Lucile
and the fluffy-haired Dutton twin had each
had her to dinner on the campus, and the
straight-haired twin, who was a basket-ball
fiend, had secured her as mascot for the sophomore
team, thereby plunging Eugenia, who
took no particular interest in basket-ball and
so had not thought of the freshman mascot,
into the depths of woe. But no amount of
flattering attention could supplant Eugenia
in Dorothy’s affections. Eugenia knew how
to talk to little girls. She had a way of appearing
when Betty was busy and Dorothy
was thinking hard of mother. Her stories
were almost as nice as Madeline’s, and she
was never too busy to tell one. It soon got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>to be a regular thing for her to slip down
from the campus in the dusk of the afternoon,
when Betty was always busiest in the tea-room,
and it was too cold and dark for a little
girl to want to play outdoors by herself.
That was Dorothy’s lonesome time&mdash;or it
would have been, but for Eugenia.</p>

<p>First Eugenia told “true stories” of dolls
and canary birds that she had had when she
was little, and of a tame toad that lived under
the door-step at home. Then she invented
the ploshkin, and after that she had to tell
how to catch and kill a ploshkin every night
for two weeks.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to catch and kill a
ploshkin?” the story began, and the answer
to that was an anxious “No,” even after you
knew quite well, by heart, how the deed was
done.</p>

<p>“The ploshkin is a sad little soul,” Eugenia
went on solemnly, “and it lives in the middle
of the bay.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“What bay?” demanded Dorothy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo4"><img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="400" alt="TRUE STORIES OF DOLLS"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">TRUE STORIES OF DOLLS</p>

<p class="p2">“The bay of the ploshkin, of course. It
lurks in the deep round hole that you see exactly
in the middle of the bay. So you must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>row out there in a skiff, taking with you a
pail of mortar.”</p>

<p>“What a funny thing to take,” giggled
Dorothy each time.</p>

<p>“The only thing,” Eugenia announced severely.
“And when the skiff is exactly in
the centre of the bay you must fasten the
prow to the top of a wave, with a pink shoe-string.”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of a pink shoe-string?”
demanded Dorothy gleefully.</p>

<p>“You have&mdash;now,” Eugenia told her.
“Where was I? Oh, yes, tie the prow to the
top of a wave with a pink shoe-string, and
then you must wait and wait and wait and
wait, till by and by the ploshkin will come
up to drink.”</p>

<p>“I should think he could drink enough
down where he was. Don’t you mean come
up to breathe?” inquired Dorothy acutely.</p>

<p>“I mean come up to drink. The ploshkin
has an ingrowing face and he drinks up, not
down. Now shall I go on with the story?”</p>

<p>“Please,” begged Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Well, when he comes up with a flip of his
tail, you must jump for the pail of mortar and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>sprinkle it on him, and he’ll be so mortified
that he’ll die of mortification.”</p>

<p>“And must you hold him by the tail?
You said ‘catch and kill,’” Dorothy reminded
her.</p>

<p>Eugenia nodded. “But it’s never been
done yet. The tail is prickly, you see, and
slippery between the pricks, and the pink
shoe-string gets in your eyes.”</p>

<p>“How could it?” demanded Dorothy.</p>

<p>“It’s enchanted,” Eugenia assured her with
the air of finality that little girls love. “And
so this is how you catch and kill a ploshkin.”</p>

<p>“Could you please make me a picture of a
ploshkin?” asked Dorothy on the third night
of the story.</p>

<p>“I can’t draw pictures, dear, but Miss Ayres
will, I’m sure,” Eugenia told her, and that
was how Madeline heard of the ploshkin, and
fell so in love with its name, its ingrowing
face, and its prickly, slippery tail, that she
spent a whole morning making sketches of it,
when she should have been pursuing her Literary
Career.</p>

<p>Dorothy displayed the sketches to all her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>friends, and the exact appearance of the ploshkin
began to be vigorously discussed in college
circles, and pictures of it adorned the fly-leaves
of note-books and the margins of corrected
themes. The fluffy-haired Dutton twin, who
took modeling, even made a comical little
clay ploshkin and presented it to Dorothy,
who thanked her and tactfully refrained from
mentioning that she had forgotten the prickly
tail. But Madeline was not so reticent, and
she and the Dutton twin together modeled
another figure that made Dorothy fairly dance
with delight. It had, besides the prickly tail,
one wing, held coquettishly before its “ingrowing
face,” which was rather like a fish’s,
except for a “sunny Jim” smile around the
mouth; and there was something inexplicably
fascinating about the grotesque huddle of its
posture.</p>

<p>“That’s a real touch of genius&mdash;that makes
you feel like laughing whenever you look at
it,” explained the Dutton twin triumphantly,
“but it won’t help me any if I cut again in
Elocution. Good-bye,” and she was off, singing,
“Midyears are coming, tra-la, tra-la,” with
a joyous disregard for time and tune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>While the others were still admiring the
new ploshkin Mary Brooks appeared.</p>

<p>“It’s two weeks, and two days, less two
hours,” she explained, when she had kissed
Dorothy and examined the ploshkin. “I
couldn’t come at the proper time, because my
Uncle Marcellus has been to visit us&mdash;the one
that gave us the desert island for a wedding
gift, you know.” Mary sighed deeply. “A
desert island is a lovely thing to own, but
when it involves an Uncle Marcellus I’d advise
anybody to think twice. Well, he’s gone
at last and here I am, to open the drawer.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring your Uncle Marcellus
in to lunch?” demanded Madeline severely.
“You haven’t been any kind of a
patron lately. And where’s your new feature
for the shop that I told you to think up?
You’re trying to shirk your responsibilities,
little Mary.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Marcellus,” said Mary calmly, “is
a vegetarian with dyspepsia. Of course I
didn’t bring him in here to find fault with
everything. New rule for the Perfect Patron:
Keep the dyspeptic vegetarian away from the
Tea-Room. As for features, I’d thought of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>something. Let me see&mdash;oh,&mdash;why, of course!
Make ploshkins.” Mary smiled her beamish
smile at the two proprietors.</p>

<p>“Now, Mary, you thought that up on the
spur of the minute,” began Madeline. “It’s
not fair&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” Mary denounced her affably.
“You’re always preaching the advantage of
impromptu inspirations.”</p>

<p>“But why should we make ploshkins?”
demanded Betty.</p>

<p>“Why indeed?” Mary beamed. “Have
you forgotten the day when the Gibson girl
hung over every desk on the Harding campus?
And after that came the Winged Victory.
Last year it was red devils, wasn’t it? Well,
now it shall be ploshkins. The Harding girl
must have her little idol, and the Tally-ho
Tea-Shop may as well have the Harding girl’s
money.”</p>

<p>“But they’d take ages to make,” objected
Madeline. “Fluffy and I spent two long and
weary afternoons on this one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so literal, child,” advised Mary.
“Have them made, I mean, of course. Get
one of those plaster statuette places in New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>York to turn them off for you. Let me see&mdash;three&mdash;five&mdash;order
five hundred. Three hundred
girls will rush to buy them, and two
hundred out of the three will get that wing
broken off before June and sorrowfully buy
another.” Mary smiled blandly. “I ought
to have been the wife of a shopkeeper,
oughtn’t I? Now may I play with your
secret drawer?”</p>

<p>Being of a fickle disposition, Mary had no
sooner received full and free permission to
play with the drawer whenever she liked,
than the secret springs lost their tremendous
attraction for her. She had just got the
drawer open when Georgia Ames appeared
and Mary promptly deserted her new plaything
to secure Georgia’s advance order for
ploshkins, and then to help her concoct a
beautiful little notice about them to be circulated
discreetly through the college.</p>

<p>“Zoology classes, Attention!” it ran. “The
ploshkin is as instructive as the grasshopper,
and you should lose no time in observing its
anatomy. To be had, without the trouble of
catching it in the Bay, at the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.
Order early.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“The name and that senseless touch about
the Bay will get them,” Mary declared, and
went home to tell George Garrison Hinsdale
all about it. So the secret drawer stood open
all day long&mdash;for Betty, who would have noticed
it, had had an exasperating struggle
with the stove, on top of a particularly irritating
time over the carriage lamps, and went
home early with a headache, leaving a message
for Eugenia, who still insisted upon coming
for lessons. Madeline found the drawer,
when she was straightening up the tea-room
for the night, and shut it in hot haste. For
what is the use of having a secret drawer at
all if you leave it wide open all day for every
one to look at?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I think</span> we ought to send for Babbie,” declared
Madeline Ayres a day or two later.</p>

<p>“To talk ploshkin?” asked Betty. The
ploshkin project was still, to Mary’s great disgust,
being discussed pro and con.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Madeline, “and to have a
say about our keeping the tea-room open for
dinners. Also, and most important of all, to
save Young-Man-Over-the-Fence from an early
grave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we ought to decide right away
about the bill for his party,” agreed Betty innocently.
“At least, we have decided, haven’t
we, that it was too much fun to take pay for?
But we ought to let him know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we undoubtedly ought, but Babbie
hasn’t a thing to do with that party,” Madeline
reminded her.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Then what&mdash;&mdash;” Betty had a
sudden inkling of Madeline’s meaning. “Do
you think he’s really interested in Babbie?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>she demanded. “Because Babbie doesn’t like
him, and she perfectly hates having men fall
in love with her.”</p>

<p>“She says she does, you mean,” corrected
Madeline, “and perhaps she even thinks she
does. But she doesn’t. No girl does, if the
man is worth anything. I like Young-Man-Over-the-Fence
myself, probably because he’s
so optimistic about my literary ability, and
I’m sorry I queered him with Babbie by my
premature announcement of his devotion. I
don’t know how I can help matters now,
though.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “He’ll help them himself,
if he wants to, I guess. He isn’t the kind to
give up easily. The very reason Babbie was
prejudiced against him was because of his determined
chin. I’ll make out his bill for the
food and the other expenses right now, before
I forget it.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Thayer came in for his tea that
afternoon and was informed of the Tally-ho’s
decision, he objected vigorously.</p>

<p>“Suppose those girls from the college did
help you a little,” he said. “Give them a
spread, if you like, to square things up, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>take my check for yourselves. You really
must, you know.”</p>

<p>Betty explained that it had been only fun
for everybody, and Madeline presented her
plan for a club-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer smiled sorrowfully. “I’ve
thought of that, and I want them to have
one; but if they have a club-house they must
have clubs. They must have clubs anyway,
for do you know”&mdash;his voice took on a tragic
intensity&mdash;“not much over half of them can
read and write. Last month I got a law
passed that prohibits their working in this
state unless they can read simple English and
write little things like their own names, and
now I find there are no evening schools in
this benighted town, and if there were, what
would old men and grown women do in a
regular evening school?”</p>

<p>“Was that the law your father didn’t
like?” asked Betty.</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer nodded gloomily. “It’s a perfectly
good law, but it’s making me no end of
trouble. Miss Wales, I’ve noticed that you
always seem to come to the rescue of despairing
mortals. Can’t you suggest something?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Betty shook her head thoughtfully. Instead
of coming to any one’s rescue she had
got to dismiss her extra waitresses again. Nobody
had time for lunches and teas just before
midyears, and even if the tea-shop should
decide to serve dinners a little later, she
might be able, with the longer hours, to get
on without extra help. Then she remembered
something funny that had come in her
morning mail.</p>

<p>“I must be queer,” she declared, “because
people&mdash;despairing mortals&mdash;want me to do
such funny things for them. This morning
I had a letter from a father whose daughter
isn’t popular in college, wanting me to show
her how to make friends. And I never even
heard of the girl before!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll do it,” Mr. Thayer declared,
preparing to take his leave, “and you’ll help
me out somehow, too. I’ve got three months’
grace from the factory commission, before my
employees must begin to attend school. Meanwhile
I shall put an architect to work on
plans for the club-house you’ve compelled me
to build by your hundred dollar donation.
And by building the club-house I put you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>under obligations to help me with the clubs.
That’s even. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“We’ve gotten ourselves into a lovely fix
now,” said Betty solemnly, staring after him.</p>

<p>“You have, please say,” Madeline corrected.
“He doesn’t expect me to do anything about
his old clubs, after the way I piled the Stockings
off on Babbie.”</p>

<p>“I should love it if I had time,” sighed
Betty. “It’s the only kind of teaching I
know enough to do, just the plain three R’s,&mdash;and
you could feel as if your work counted
for something, when they must learn and
can’t in any other way.”</p>

<p>“It would be splendid practice,” added
Madeline. “I should almost think some of
the college girls who are going to teach might
like to take classes a night or two each week.”</p>

<p>Betty gave a little cry of pleased assent.
“Why, of course! Why didn’t you think of
that when he was here, Madeline? I know
they’d like it, and girls who don’t mean to
teach would, too&mdash;Fluffy Dutton and Georgia
and their kind. They’d like the queerness
of it.”</p>

<p>“I might even take a class myself,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>Madeline conceded, “if I were allowed to
choose my pupils. I hereby speak for my
fascinating little Italian boy.”</p>

<p>“It will be a fine chance to practice modern
languages, too,” cried Betty eagerly. “Some
girls will like it for that. But the classes
wouldn’t get on very fast, studying only a
night a week; and every night would be a
good deal to give. Oh, Madeline, I know
what! He could hire some girls for the big
stupid classes that would have to come several
nights a week, and that would help with the
Student’s Aid work.”</p>

<p>“You’re worrying about those waitresses
again,” said Madeline accusingly. “I believe
you care more about them than you do about
tea-room profits.”</p>

<p>“You don’t really think that, do you,
Madeline?” demanded Betty solemnly, “because
the tea-room pays me for looking out
for its profits, and if I didn’t put that ahead
of anything else, I shouldn’t be honest.”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t think it,” Madeline told
her quickly, with a loving little hug. “You’re
altogether too honest, and you work lots
harder than you ought to. If we decide to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>serve dinners, I shall insist on your having
an assistant. And that will be more help for
the Student’s Aid,” she added mockingly, and
went off to Dramatic Club’s dress rehearsal of
the Masque of the Twelfth Night Cakes.</p>

<p>A few moments later the carriage lamp
above Betty’s desk flickered uncertainly and
grew dim.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I never filled one lamp this morning!”
sighed Betty. The stove and the
lamps were the hardest things in her winter’s
experience. Bridget had announced, soon
after her arrival, that she couldn’t be “bothered
wid ony ile lamps,” and Nora had remarked
pointedly that nowadays you needn’t
expect any girl to fuss with those old-fashioned
ways of lighting. So Betty, valuing
Bridget and Nora too highly to take any
risks, had quietly assumed the care of the
lamps and later of the stove. She didn’t dare
to carry a light near the kerosene can, and in
groping her way to it she tore her sleeve on a
nail and got a sliver in her finger. She had
pinned together the tear and taken out the
sliver, and she was sitting by the open fire,
trying to finish up the repairs by smoothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>out her ruffled temper, when Eugenia Ford
appeared, looking provokingly spick-and-span
and elegant in new furs that her father had
just sent her.</p>

<p>“He knew he was mean to keep me here
over Christmas,” said Eugenia, when she had
duly exhibited her treasures. “Is your headache
all gone, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I’d forgotten that I ever
had one. That was two days ago, wasn’t it?
I was sorry to make you miss a lesson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it didn’t matter,” Eugenia said easily.
She was in a very complacent mood to-day.
“I told Miss Ayres that it didn’t matter. I’ve
had two ‘very goods’ said to me in geometry
recitations this week, and I wasn’t sat upon
in Lit. to-day. That’s the most of a compliment
you can hope for in Lit. unless you’re a
perfect wizard.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get careless and let things go,”
Betty warned her solemnly. “And when
you’re cramming, if you find one single little
thing that you don’t understand, you’d better
come and let me explain about it.” Betty
flushed uncomfortably. The financial side of
such affairs she found very embarrassing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>“It won’t be anything extra; it will just be a
favor to me. I shall feel so nervous until I
know you’re through all right.”</p>

<p>Eugenia nodded brusquely. “I suppose
they’re always dreadfully down on people
who’ve had warnings, but I guess I shall get
along.” She seemed restless and ill at ease
somehow, saying almost nothing, answering
Betty’s questions at random, not even noticing
the ploshkin that she had gone into raptures
over when she had seen it before, or inquiring
for little Dorothy, as she did invariably
whenever she came in.</p>

<p>“She’s probably worried to death and too
proud to let me see it,” Betty decided; but
that was an absurd supposition, considering all
the tears that Eugenia had taken small pains
to dissemble. Finally it came out.</p>

<p>“I must be going,” Eugenia announced at
last with sudden briskness. “I only stopped
to inquire for your headache. Oh, yes&mdash;and
I presume I’d better take my theme, because
it’s due to-morrow morning, and I may not
be down this way again. Did you read it, Miss
Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty’s brow puckered in perplexity. “Your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>theme? Were you to have one ready for the
other day? I thought it was only the last
six propositions in geometry that we were
going over together. Madeline didn’t give
me any theme.”</p>

<p>“No,” explained Eugenia. “I didn’t tell
her anything about it. I just dropped it on
your desk. I thought you’d notice it and
read it, and if you found anything fearfully
wrong, I could fix it over.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand what theme it
was. We went over all those that I assigned;
and you revised them, and then we went over
them again.”</p>

<p>“This was my ‘final,’” explained Eugenia.</p>

<p>“Your ‘final’!” Betty’s tone was full of
dismay. “But I wasn’t to see that, Eugenia.
That’s to be entirely your own work, like all
the themes you handed in before you were
warned. Don’t you remember I told you
how Miss Raymond called a meeting of English
tutors to explain that they were to give
no help of any kind on the ‘final’ theme;
and she announced it in classes too, didn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, if you take it that way”&mdash;Eugenia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
assumed an air of injured innocence.
“Most of the tutors don’t. You see, Miss
Wales, some of the girls are worried to death
and bother their tutors for ideas and pointers
until the poor things just about write their
freshmen’s themes to get rid of them. Of
course they won’t&mdash;or they oughtn’t to&mdash;do
that with the ‘final.’ That’s the help Miss
Raymond meant.”</p>

<p>“So is reading it over and making suggestions
giving help,” Betty objected. “She
meant help of any kind&mdash;or at least that was
what she said.”</p>

<p>Eugenia shrugged her shoulders. “All
right,” she said. “There’s no harm done, as
long as you haven’t even seen the old thing.
It’s due to-morrow anyway, and all I expected
you to tell me was little things like
misspelled words or slips of the pen. I
couldn’t copy it all over to-night possibly.”</p>

<p>Betty always tried to put the best construction
on actions that didn’t seem to her quite
honorable. “Oh, if that’s all you wanted,
why I don’t suppose any one would object.
But it’s better to keep exactly to Miss Raymond’s
regulations, don’t you think so? If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>you try hard, you can find little things like
misspelled words for yourself. You will go
over it carefully, won’t you?” Betty added
earnestly. “I heard of a girl once who was
conditioned on account of bad spelling. That
would be a perfect shame, after all the time
we’ve spent studying really hard things like
outlines.”</p>

<p>While she talked, Betty was looking
through her pigeonholes, where neat little
piles of bills and memoranda for the different
parts of the tea-room business were kept.
After one week of chaos she had decided that
order was the first law of business; and since
then her desk had been a model of neatness
and system.</p>

<p>“Where did you say you left the theme,
Eugenia?” she asked after a minute, looking
up from her search.</p>

<p>“Right out on top,” explained Eugenia.
“Isn’t it there? Seems to me a drawer was
open. Maybe it got slipped in by mistake
with something else, when the drawer was
shut.”</p>

<p>Betty opened every drawer and looked
carefully through the contents. Then she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>went through the pigeonholes again, while
Eugenia waited, anxiety fast taking the place
of her serene assurance.</p>

<p>“It’s not here,” Betty announced at last.
“Are you perfectly sure you left it, Eugenia?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. You see,” Eugenia, being
thoroughly frightened, became, according to
her custom, perfectly frank and open. “You
see I knew you’d think it was cheating to
help on a ‘final,’ no matter if all&mdash;well,
some,” she amended hastily, “of the regular
tutors do it. So I folded it up and laid it on
your desk where I thought you’d naturally
pick it up to see what it was. And after
you’d begun it, I thought you’d finish out of
curiosity, because you’re so interested in my
not flunking. And if you thought it was a
fright I just hoped you wouldn’t be able to
resist bringing it to me to revise. I guess it
wasn’t honest, and I never mean to actually
cheat,” ended Eugenia, with a feeling for nice
distinctions, “so I’m really and truly glad
you didn’t find it before. But it must be
there, Miss Wales. It simply must.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” Betty answered with decision.
“I’ve looked twice at every single paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“Then somebody has taken it.”</p>

<p>Betty considered. “You might have
picked it up yourself, Eugenia, with your
other things, in a fit of absent-mindedness.
The maids never touch this desk. The only
other person who could possibly have moved
it is Madeline. She was writing here, I
think, the day you say you left it. She’s up
on the campus now. You go and hunt
through your room, and as soon as she comes
home, I’ll ask her about it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t either of us find it?”
queried Eugenia anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall find it,” Betty assured her.
“I’m almost sure you took it off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I didn’t, Miss Wales,” declared
Eugenia. “I know I didn’t, but I’ll go and
look. And if I don’t find it, I shall come
right back here to see if Miss Ayres has it.
Oh, just think&mdash;what if it’s lost for keeps?”
Eugenia fastened her sable furs as unconcernedly
as if they had been last year’s style
and squirrel, and rushed off, her eyes big
with terror.</p>

<p>Betty went over the desk again, just to be
doing something. Just before Madeline arrived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
she remembered the secret drawer.
The theme was in that, of course! When
Madeline declared that she hadn’t seen it, and
that it couldn’t be with her papers, because
she hadn’t had any on the desk for five days,
Betty insisted on her opening the secret drawer.</p>

<p>“I simply must learn to open it,” she said.
“I knew something would get lost in there,
and if you were away, I shouldn’t be able to
get it out. There, Madeline, that’s the way
you did it the first time you opened it. I
think I shall remember now. Oh, it isn’t
there! I do hope she’s found it herself.”</p>

<p>But a minute later Eugenia burst in, arrayed
in her roommate’s oldest raincoat, furs
and complacence alike discarded. “Have
you found it?” she cried. “Because I knew
I shouldn’t, and I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Eugenia! No, it isn’t here. Madeline,
do come and suggest what to do.”</p>

<p>Madeline was as sympathetic as possible,
but even her vaunted resourcefulness could
find no feasible remedy for Eugenia’s plight.</p>

<p>“Ask for more time,” she began.</p>

<p>“She won’t give it unless you’ve been
sick,” Eugenia objected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“Go home and write your theme to-night.
You can do it, with coffee and wet towels. If
your matron is fussy about lights, come down
to our house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t,” declared Eugenia tragically.
“I can’t hurry on themes. I’m as
slow as a snail when I try to write sense. I
spent six evenings on this, outside of copying.”</p>

<p>“Then go and explain that you’ve lost it,
and throw yourself on the lady’s tender
mercies. Go right away, so she won’t be irritated
beforehand by all the other regular
eleventh hour excuses.”</p>

<p>Eugenia considered. “I suppose that’s the
only thing to do. If I hurry I can get there
before dinner. Between tea and dinner is
her good-natured time.” Eugenia pulled up
the raincoat, which was much too long for
her, and started off.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she was back again,
shivering forlornly with the cold and choking
with tears.</p>

<p>“I told her. I told her exactly how I happened
to lose it, because she asked me, and I
never thought how awful it would look. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>says I’m a cheat, and don’t deserve more
time. She says she’ll flunk me in the course,
and she hopes I’ll flunk enough other things
so I can’t stay in college. Oh, Miss Wales,
what shall I do? I told my father I was all
caught up. He doesn’t know about midyears.
I guess that wasn’t honest either, to say I was
caught up before I’d passed the exams. If
I’m flunked out now I shan’t ever dare go
home. Oh, what shall I do? What shall I
do? What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Betty tucked the forlorn, weeping little
bundle into a chair, heaped more wood on
the fire that she had been trying to put out,
brewed hot tea, and hunted through the
larder for tempting “left-overs” that would
make up an appetizing little supper for two.
When Madeline and the smallest sister came
to see, as Dorothy put it, whether the ploshkin
had caught and killed Betty, she sent
them away with a hastily whispered explanation.</p>

<p>“Now first,” she told Eugenia, “you’re to
stop crying or you’ll make yourself sick, and
then where will your midyears be? And
secondly you’re to eat what I’ve cooked, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
it isn’t polite to act as if you didn’t
like my cooking. And thirdly you’re to
escort me as far as the door of the Davidson.
I’m going to see Miss Raymond. I’m sure
you misunderstood part of what she said, because
she isn’t the kind to speak that way.
If she has made up her mind to flunk you, I
don’t know that I can do anything, but I’m
going to try.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t bother,” moaned Eugenia.
“It’s no use. I suppose it was cheating.
You said it was yourself.”</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you specially not to
bring the ‘final’ theme to me,” Betty told
her. “And if you did leave it here, why,
I’m responsible in a way for its loss. I shall
tell Miss Raymond that. I can’t have you
fail because something you left with me has
disappeared off the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>On their way Betty told Eugenia to walk
ahead slowly while she ran up to bid Dorothy
good-night.</p>

<p>“I just hate to go,” she told Madeline. “I
don’t know Miss Raymond very well. If it
was Miss Ferris, I should know just what to
say; but I’m afraid Miss Raymond will think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>it was partly my doings that Eugenia brought
me the theme. I just hate to be mixed up
in anything that isn’t perfectly straight.”</p>

<p>“Then let her get out of it as best she can
herself.”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “That certainly
wouldn’t be straight,” she declared. “I’m
helping her because the theme was lost off
my desk&mdash;and because she’s been so sweet to
Dorothy.”</p>

<p>After all, the interview wasn’t so dreadful.
Miss Raymond began by thanking Betty for
coming at once to explain her side of the affair.</p>

<p>“Though of course I knew all that you
have told me about the part you took,” she
said. “But one thing more&mdash;do you think
Miss Ford is telling the truth about her part?
You think she really wrote the theme?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m sure she did,” Betty answered
earnestly. “She has queer ideas
about what would be fair and honest, but I’m
sure she doesn’t tell out-and-out lies. Besides,
how would she ever think of such a
story?”</p>

<p>“It’s no stranger than others I’ve listened
to that proved to be the invention of girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>stupider than Eugenia Ford,” Miss Raymond
assured her smilingly. “But I shall accept
your judgment in the matter.”</p>

<p>“And give her a chance to write another
theme?” asked Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>Miss Raymond hesitated. “I don’t see
how I can do that, when I have refused half
a dozen others who had better excuses. But
what’s lost generally turns up, doesn’t it?
Suppose I give Miss Ford three weeks, in the
hope that her theme will come to light. Of
course I shall trust to her honor not to write
another and substitute it for the original.”</p>

<p>“But if it doesn’t come to light?” Betty
knew just how thoroughly she had ransacked
her desk.</p>

<p>Miss Raymond considered. “Then what I
can do will depend on the reports I get from
her other instructors&mdash;and from you, if you
are to continue tutoring her.”</p>

<p>Betty blushed violently. “If you remember
my themes, Miss Raymond, I know you
think it’s perfectly crazy for me to be tutoring
in English.” And she explained how
she had been driven to beginning with
Eugenia, and then not allowed to stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“When I see the ‘final’ I can judge better
how successful you’ve been,” Miss Raymond
told her cordially, “but I imagine you’ve
done good work. The best writers don’t
make the best teachers. What was her subject?”</p>

<p>Betty blushed again. “‘Little Girls.’ I’d
kept telling her to take something definite
and something she knew about, instead of
hope, and Japanese gardens, and things of
that kind. But ‘Little Girls’ is a sort of
ridiculous title, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sounds rather promising to me,” Miss
Raymond said. “I hope I shall have the
opportunity of reading about ‘Little Girls.’
Will you explain our arrangement to Miss
Ford?” And Betty felt that she was dismissed.</p>

<p>She hurried over to tell Eugenia how far
she had succeeded, and Eugenia cheered up
perceptibly over the ray of hope held out to
her, and even found heart to taste the fudge
that her sympathetic roommate had made to
comfort her.</p>

<p>Betty finished off her evening with a call
on Miss Ferris, who assured her, in answer to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>her apologetic account of the situation, that
she didn’t in the least regret, nevertheless,
having practically compelled Betty to tutor
Eugenia.</p>

<p>“And Eugenia is quite right; you can’t
stop now,” she declared laughingly, and then
grew serious. “This episode is hard on both
of you, but it will result in her practicing, if
she doesn’t fully accept, a higher code of
honor. Then you say she has learned to
work, and this is her chance to show it.
Miss Raymond won’t be hard on her if she
shows that she means to do her best. You
didn’t think I expected you to change all her
spots in a minute, did you?”</p>

<p>Betty went home, feeling that a great load
was off her shoulders. To be sure, she was
perfectly certain that Eugenia’s theme was
lost “for keeps,” but nobody, not even
Eugenia, seemed to blame her. And something
would surely happen to make things
come right.</p>

<p>At home something had already happened
to make things interesting, in the shape of a
telegram from Babbie, who had decided to
come up to Harding, although Madeline had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>not yet carried out her plan of sending for
her. And so she didn’t know a word about
the ploshkin or the dinner project. It wasn’t
to discuss those, certainly, that she was coming
to Harding.</p>

<span class="smaller">MORE “SIDE-LINES”</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of her arrival Babbie had
tea, alone and very early, at the Tally-ho.
Just after Nora had served her, Mr. Thayer
appeared. He came over to Babbie’s table to
shake hands, as a matter of course, and he
lingered over the process until the very least
Babbie could do was to invite him to share
her repast.</p>

<p>“I met a cousin of yours,” she informed
him, “at the week-end party I’ve just come
from&mdash;Mr. Austin Thayer. I saw a lot of
him, and we got quite chummy.”</p>

<p>“Austin’s a fine fellow,” agreed Mr. Thayer
cordially, “but he and I disagree about so
many things&mdash;we don’t hit it off at all.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Babbie serenely, crushing a
slice of lemon relentlessly with her tiny
wooden spoon&mdash;Japanese spoons, for the Japanese
teas were the latest innovation at the
Tally-ho. “Your cousin Austin thinks you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>are ‘a very foolish boy,’ to quote his own
words. We discussed you at dinner last
evening.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer flushed. “And did you defend
me just a little?” he asked. “Because
if you didn’t, considering what Austin has
called me now and then, I don’t see how
there could have been much discussion.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you make a point of it, it wasn’t
a discussion,” Babbie told him coldly. “It
was an&mdash;an exchange of experiences. He
told me what he knew about your past life,
and I told him the very little I know about
your present activities.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer smiled a perfunctory smile.
“It must have been a desperately dull dinner.
My affairs are never the least bit exciting.
Next time you meet Austin at anybody’s
week-end, make him talk about
himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did that too,” Babbie explained,
“sitting out dances the first evening. He’s
had piles of fascinating experiences. If I
were a man I think I should go in for the
same sort of thing exactly. I love the way
he pounces down on the Stock Exchange,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>straight out of a South African jungle, and
after he’s made two or three millions calmly
departs again to climb Mount McKinley, or
motor through Tibet. And when his two millions
are spent, he builds a town or sells a gold
mine, and then buys a castle on the Hudson
and a car and a motor-boat, and tries another
kind of fun. He doesn’t bother with employees
and fiddling little plans for making
them ‘safer and happier,’” Babbie quoted
maliciously.</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t,” returned Mr. Thayer with
asperity. “They mobbed him once in Chicago,
because he’d cornered the wheat supply and
the price of bread had nearly doubled.”</p>

<p>“Was that the time he made five millions
in three months?” asked Babbie blandly.</p>

<p>That evening, while Babbie, in a ruffly pink
negligee, sat cross-legged on Madeline’s couch,
eating fudges and playing with the ploshkin,
she explained to her two friends that the week-end
party had “bored her to tears.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a possible man there, and
Margot kept pairing me off with a fright of a
millionaire who was always getting you into
a corner and making you listen to wild tales
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>of gigantic business ventures he’d pulled off.
I detest business. Money should be seen
and not heard,” ended Babbie sententiously.</p>

<p>But the next afternoon she rushed out of
Flying Hoof’s stall, where she was being entertained
at tea by some adoring freshmen, to
inform Mr. Robert Thayer that his cousin Austin
had sent him kind regards.</p>

<p>“In a note, you know.” She fluttered it
before him tantalizingly. “We’re both invited
to another house-party, you see. He wants to
know if I’m going to accept.”</p>

<p>“And are you?” ventured Mr. Thayer.
“That is, if I may ask, by way of showing a
cousinly interest in Austin’s happiness.”</p>

<p>“Most certainly not,” snapped Babbie
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Ah, I beg a thousand pardons! I was only
joking, Miss Hildreth.”</p>

<p>“I’m most certainly not going, I mean,”
Babbie explained amiably, after a moment of
frowning perplexity, and swept back to her
tea-party, leaving a completely bewildered
young man behind her.</p>

<p>He relieved his feelings by telling Betty the
good news about the club-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve bought that big, old-fashioned place
across the street from the factory. We couldn’t
have begun building before April, and it
seemed out of the question to delay so long.
Besides, this is just the thing, or it will be in
a month, when the architect and his minions
have finished with it. I told him that you
people changed a barn into a tea-shop in ten
days, and if he can’t alter a few partitions,
paper a few walls, and get in the furniture in
a month, he needn’t expect any more work
from yours truly. So bring on your college
girls, find out who wants to teach what and to
whom, and tell me which ones are to go on the
pay-roll and which are ready to give their
services. I’ll send you a list of the prospective
pupils, with ages and nationalities attached.”
He paused and looked sharply at
Betty. “Are you tired to-night, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “I’ve lost something,
and I’m being foolish and worrying over it.”</p>

<p>“You work too hard,” Mr. Thayer decreed.
“When I’m overworked I always lose my
gloves. It’s a sure sign. You’re not to be bothered
with those lists. But the trouble is, I
don’t know the college girls. There’s got to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>somebody for a go-between. Could I hire one
of the hire-able ones for a sort of secretary?”</p>

<p>Betty considered. “Midyears are making
everybody awfully busy now and it wouldn’t do
to wait ten days or so, till they’re over, would it?
Besides, this thing will have to be managed just
right to give it a good start. Why don’t you
ask Babbie? She’s awfully good at things
like that, and awfully interested in the club-house
idea.”</p>

<p>“Is she?” gasped Mr. Thayer.</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “She says she thinks the
finest thing a rich man can do is to look after
the men and women who are making his
money for him.”</p>

<p>“She said that?” gasped Mr. Thayer again.
Then he looked pleadingly at Betty. “Would
you ask her to take charge, please? I think
she’d do it quicker for you.”</p>

<p>And he hurried off, leaving Betty to piece
together all the things Babbie had said and
done in connection with Mr. Thayer, and all
that he had said and done in connection with
Babbie. Her final conclusions were, first, that
Mr. Thayer was afraid of Babbie; second, that
Babbie was interested in Mr. Thayer’s work,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>but not in Mr. Thayer; and third, that Madeline
was therefore mistaken, owing to an over-romantic
tendency developed by the writing
of a great many love-stories.</p>

<p>In any case Babbie readily agreed to post
notices about the opening of the stocking
factory’s classes, see that the most promising
volunteer teachers got the most difficult
pupils, interview the Student’s Aid officers
about the paid instructors, and be present
during the evenings of the first week to make
sure that each teacher found her class and
that things ran smoothly.</p>

<p>“It’s a good excuse to delay going South
until next month,” she said. “Mother is just
as bored by Southern resorts as I am, but she
hasn’t the strength of mind to break off the
habit of going to them. So she’ll be secretly
relieved, and as proud as Punch, too, to think
that I’m bossing a big evening-school.
Mother’s purely ornamental herself, so she
admires the useful type of woman. I must
write her immediately about the tea-shop’s
latest departure. Betty, can’t you induce Mr.
Thayer to serve coffee and sandwiches to the
ones that learn their lessons nicely, and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>the tea-shop will be making something out of
my school.”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get our dinners started, before
we begin on nine-o’clock lunches,” Betty advised
her.</p>

<p>“I shall order the very grandest dinner you
can imagine for the opening night,” declared
Babbie enthusiastically, “so you must manage
to start before I leave.”</p>

<p>“We can have new menu cards now,” put
in Madeline. “I never did like the color of
these, and besides I think Bob Enderby ought
to put a gift-shop in one corner of the design
he drew for us. It certainly ought to be
noticed in some way on the menu.”</p>

<p>“I think he ought to add a night-school
too,” declared Babbie playfully, “and a notice
that Betty does tutoring. If we’re broadening
out so much, we ought to let people know
all about it.”</p>

<p>“Just because you happen to be running it,
the night-school isn’t a branch of the tea-shop,
Babbie,” demurred Madeline. “Wait until
Mr. Thayer actually promises to buy the sandwiches
before you consider it a part of the
‘eats’ business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s an outgrowth of it,” retorted
Babbie. “The tea-shop is responsible for the
club-house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if we’re going to put all that the tea-shop
is responsible for on the menu,” Madeline
began, with a provoking little smile, “we
should have to put on a picture of a broken
h&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come, girls,” interposed Betty, hastily,
foreseeing another blundering reference from
Madeline to Mr. Thayer’s devotion to Babbie,
“don’t quarrel about unimportant little things
like menu cards, but let’s discuss what we
shall serve and what new china we need.”</p>

<p>“Oh, new china!” cried Madeline in great
excitement. “I hadn’t thought of that! I
shall go to New York to buy it. Now, whoever
said the fat little mustard jars were an
extravagance? We shall use them a lot for
dinners.”</p>

<p>Betty banged the table for order. “Now
how many dinner plates shall we buy to begin
with?” she inquired in businesslike tones.</p>

<p>Madeline banged the table noisily in her
turn. “I know something much more important
than dinner plates,” she declared ostentatiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> “Do let’s be businesslike,
Betty, and systematic. Your haphazard methods
jar upon my order-loving soul.”</p>

<p>Betty waited resignedly.</p>

<p>“The most important thing is an assistant
for you,” Madeline went on. “You can’t do
more than you are doing now. If we serve
dinners, there will be more marketing, more
accounts, more to see to all around the place,
and longer hours for the cashier.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course Betty must have an assistant,”
chimed in Babbie, “and a bigger salary.
It’s not fair for us to be making such good
profits when she works so hard.”</p>

<p>“You’ll make more, even with a good many
extra expenses, if the dinners go as I think
they will,” put in Betty, forcing her associates
to listen, while she explained what could be
done if the average dinner check was so-and-so,
the average attendance so-and-so, and the
additional expenses kept down to this and
that.</p>

<p>“All right; let’s serve dinners by all
means,” said Babbie gaily. “I hate averages,
because as far as I can see they never come
out the way you want them, but I’m all for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>expansion. Mummy will like it too. She’s
awfully proud of us. Now Betty can do a
go-as-you-please on the details, can’t she,
Madeline? We only bother by putting in
our oars; we’re such ignoramuses.”</p>

<p>Empowered to choose her own assistant,
Betty spent two days anxiously considering
various possibilities. If only it were fall, and
Katherine or Rachel were free to try this unconventional
way of earning a living! And
then, just at the crucial moment, when she
had almost decided to ask a junior who was
working her way through college to come
and try the work for the rest of the term, arrived
a letter from Emily Davis, with moving
pathos behind its story of a bitter disappointment
bravely accepted.</p>

<p>“I can’t blame my old eyes,” Emily wrote,
“because they’ve served me long and well,
and I’ve overdriven the poor beasties shamefully.
So now they balk, and the doctor says
they just must be humored. They’ll hold
my position in the school for me until next
fall. In the meantime I’m hunting for any
honest means of livelihood that doesn’t require
eyes. I should cry a few tears at having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
to give up this perfectly splendid position
that I was so elated to get; but crying is very
bad for the eyes, so I smile and smile and
keep on thinking how in the world I can
manage to earn my bread and butter until
next September. This summer, if worse
comes to worst, I can wait on table at a seaside
resort. Please don’t think I’m hinting
for a chance to do it at the Tally-ho. I
should hate to explain to everybody I know
at Harding how it happens that I’m back at
an underclass girl’s last resort&mdash;I, who was a
star tutor way back in my junior year, and
who meant to come to our reunion in June a
star teacher, with all the money I borrowed
to go through college paid back, and enough
left for board at my sister’s through a restful
summer. And now the oculist’s bill is gobbling
up everything in sight.</p>

<p>“What a growl! But this is a safety-valve
letter, Betty. As you are earning your living
too, I feel extra sure you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>“What she means is, she feels sure that I
won’t offer her money,” Betty reflected
shrewdly. “And isn’t it just splendid that I
can offer her a good position!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>For of course Emily was the very one to be
assistant manager. To be sure, Betty hated
the clerical work, and had planned to have
her assistant take charge of the accounts.
But the keeping of those was a small thing
compared to having dear old comical Emily
Davis back, with her famous “stunts,” her
cheerful fashion of meeting defeat and failure
with a smile, and her marvelous ability to
work twice as hard as any one else and yet
always appear calm and collected and unhurried.
Betty had a feeling that Emily
would insist upon attending to the lamps and
the stove. She wouldn’t let her do it all, of
course&mdash;she knew too well how hard it was&mdash;but
just a little help would be such a
relief.</p>

<p>Of course Babbie and Madeline were as
eager as Betty to have Emily join the tea-room’s
force, and Emily could not have resisted
the combined logic and pleading
of the three letters they sent her, even
if she had wanted to. So she wrote back
post-haste a grateful acceptance of their offer
and promised to be on hand within a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>There remained still the ploshkin project
to consider. The tea-room’s uninvested capital
would just about buy the extra china and
other equipments needed for the dinner
service. Betty was averse to asking Mrs.
Hildreth or Mrs. Bob for more money, and
the profits had been divided in January, so
they were not available. But Betty had kept
her emergency fund intact all winter, as her
father had advised, and she had added to it
appreciably from her salary, her tutoring
money, and her work for the gift-shop department.
It was now well on toward spring,
and the tea-shop had fully proved its money-making
capacities.</p>

<p>“So, if you don’t mind, I should like to
have the ploshkins made with the money
that father gave me, if it’s enough&mdash;and it
will be if Madeline can get them done at
about what she and Mary thought would be a
good investment. Then I’ll sell them here,
and give the shop a small commission, as the
college girls did when we sold their things
before Christmas.”</p>

<p>This was perfectly satisfactory to everybody,
and Madeline departed gaily to pay visits in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>Bohemia, see editors, match china, and get
ploshkins manufactured&mdash;a potpourri of assorted
activities that thoroughly delighted
her variety-loving temperament.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE REVOLT OF THE “WHY-GET-UPS”</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the dull season between midyears
and spring vacation&mdash;a time that makes the
ordinary Hardingite restless, and drives the
clever ones to all sorts of absurdities and extravagances.
The best stunts are always invented
at this season, and the wildest pranks
perpetrated. This year Prexy guilelessly announced
in chapel that “bobbing” and
“hitching” with sleds were not, in his estimation,
dignified forms of recreation for the
“womanly woman” who was Harding’s ideal.
So with dust-pan coasting also under the ban,
and the ice on the skating-rink frozen humpy&mdash;just
to be spiteful, Georgia Ames declared&mdash;the
dull season opened ten times duller than
usual.</p>

<p>Of course Betty heard all about the “anti-bob”
ordinance, and sympathized duly with
its downtrodden victims.</p>

<p>“There are getting to be too many old rules
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>in this place, anyway,” declared Lucile Merrifield
hotly, as they discussed the matter over
their teacups in Flying Hoof’s stall. “We’re
supposed to be sensible, reasonable creatures
and to know what’s permissible in this rural
retreat. I shouldn’t go ‘hitching’ in New
York. I should probably wear my hat there
when I went out shopping. Prexy doesn’t
give his sweet creation, the womanly woman,
credit for ordinary intelligence.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be able to if he heard you
talk, my dear,” Polly Eastman told her
soothingly. “Have some more of Betty’s
Cousin Kate cookies. They’re very good for
the temper, and not against the rules.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” demanded Lucile acidly.
“There are so many rules now that I shouldn’t
pretend to keep them all in my head at
once.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get Madeline and make her tell tea-ground
fortunes,” suggested Georgia. “I’m
tired of all this fuss about rules.”</p>

<p>But Madeline, who was in the loft writing,
had overheard enough of the conversation to
enable her to make her fortunes timely, and the
“anti-bob” ordinance was not yet disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got a tempest in your teacup,
Lucile,” she announced. “It’s a frightful
brain-storm brought on by the lack of your
favorite outdoor exercise. Isn’t ‘hitching’
your favorite exercise, dearie? Well, do you
see that? That’s a tipped-over sleigh. A
brain-storm is better than an early and ignominious
death encountered while ‘hitching,’
Lucile. But you’re going to do something
very silly during the brain-storm.” Madeline
frowned portentously over the grounds in
Lucile’s cup. “I think I see Prexy&mdash;yes, the
venerable Prexy himself is in here. You’ll
be called up before the powers, Lucile, to answer
for your foolishness, so beware.”</p>

<p>Lucile smiled her subtle, far-away smile&mdash;it
was first cousin to Mary Brooks’s “beamish”
one. “That will at least be exciting,”
she said. “Fluffy Dutton, what do you say
to a race to see which of us can break the
most of their old rules at one go?”</p>

<p>Fluffy shook her curly head vigorously.
“I’ve been up before the powers once, thank
you, for too many lights after ten and cutting
Greek prose and being back late after Christmas.
I don’t care for it at all. If he’d glare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>and storm it wouldn’t be so bad, but when he
appeals to your better judgment&mdash;&mdash;” Fluffy
shrugged expressively. “He treats you like
an equal, and looks at you hard and shakes
hands so nicely when he’s finished you up.
And then you go off feeling like a marked-down
bargain-lot of last night’s faded violets.
No, thank you, Lucile. I’ll race you anywhere
you like except to interviews with
Prexy.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Fluffy.” Georgia patted
her on the back approvingly. “I didn’t
think you had so much sense.”</p>

<p>“Lucile has just as much, only she’s trying
to deceive us about it,” put in Betty, who
had come over to hear the fortunes.</p>

<p>And then Madeline discovered a tall, light-haired
suitor in Polly’s cup, and being accused
of inventing him pointed him out to the satisfaction
of the assembled company. And
when Polly vehemently denied knowing a
single light-haired man, she predicted a
speedy meeting, a box of chocolates, an adventure
by water, and a summer together by
more water.</p>

<p>“Prom. man, of course,” explained Georgia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>easily, “invited for you by Lucile-of-the-vast-masculine-acquaintance,
after your own man
has decided to break his arm. Really, girls,
there ought to be a rule against proms., because
of the broken bones they produce.
Well, Lucile’s friend will take you out on
Paradise, thinking he can paddle, and upset
you. And then he’ll spend the summer at
Squirrel Island, where you always go. That’s
easy. Madeline, just tell me if there’s a suitor
in my cup, please. That’s all I care about.
Your presents and trips abroad don’t interest
me a bit.”</p>

<p>Betty had quite forgotten this conversation
when, a week or so later, Polly Eastman appeared
one morning at the Tally-ho.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to rent your loft for a little
party?” she demanded. “It’s bigger than
the down-town hall, and it will be so nice to
sit down here between times. We want extra-good
eats too, so you’ll get very wealthy out
of us.”</p>

<p>“What in the world do you want to give a
girl-dance for?” demanded Betty. “By
junior year we were all pretty tired of them,
except Helen Chase Adams, who never had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>chance to go to any other kind. This is a girl-affair,
of course?”</p>

<p>Polly was busily examining the depleted
gift-shop table. “I always meant to buy a
pair of these candle-shades,” she said, holding
up one of the Tally-ho’s specials. “Will you
take the order now? Did you ask who was
giving the affair, Betty? Oh, just our own
crowd&mdash;the ‘Why-Get-Up-to-Breakfast Club,’
and a few choice spirits who’ve been invited
to join us. Eats for thirty, I think Lucile
said; and we want them very grand and quite
regardless of expense. About three courses,
and all nice and spicy, the way campus food
never is.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s such a funny idea,” pursued
Betty. “Your house party comes before long,
doesn’t it? Why in the world don’t you wait
for that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but lemonade for refreshments
and a crowd of stupidities that you can’t get
away from,” explained Polly succinctly.
“Will it be all right about the loft, Betty?
I’m due at chemistry lab., and I promised the
others that I’d have this business all arranged
by lunch-time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Why, ye-es,” began Betty doubtfully.
“You can have it, I think. The gift-shop
workroom may as well be closed until next
fall, and Madeline’s papers are used to being
moved around. I suppose a little dance like
this is just like a party in a campus room.
You don’t have to get permission from anyone,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Easily not,” Polly assured her calmly.
“It’s exactly the same thing as a dinner down
here, or a spread. You’ve had spreads down
here, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell them it’s all right.” Polly
tucked her armful of books more securely
under her arm and started off. “Did I say
that it was next Saturday evening? We want
the eats at half-past nine, before everything
but the last dance.”</p>

<p>Betty began planning the menu and estimating
expenses at once, reflecting as she did
so that there was certainly no accounting for
tastes, and half wishing she had suggested to
Polly that a three course supper wasn’t at all
in keeping with the best Harding traditions.
“The Merry Hearts” had not exactly handed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>down their ideals to the “Why-Get-Ups,” but
the one society had largely taken the other’s
place in the life of the college.</p>

<p>“This kind of thing makes people talk
about the fashionable amusements here and
the money it costs to go through Harding College.
I wish I’d&mdash;&mdash;” Betty remembered
suddenly that her first duty was to the tea-shop,
and went at her figures in earnest, trying
to feel properly elated over the big order
and the new source of revenue suggested by
Polly’s idea of renting the loft.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday of the next week, and
oddly enough not one of the “Why-Get-Ups”
had been in for breakfast, lunch, or tea. They
were saving up for their spread-eagle party,
Betty thought, until the high-pitched chatter
of two Belden House freshmen explained the
“Why-Get-Ups’” unusual party, and suggested
several other possible reasons why they stayed
away from the Tally-ho.</p>

<p>“I’m just broken hearted,” one freshman
declared in her shrill treble. “You see when
I asked Marie to our house-party, she promised
to come if she could have a dance with
Lucile Merrifield. And now Lucile isn’t coming.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
I thought girls always went to their
house-parties.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no, dear,” the other told her
importantly. “That is, they always have before,
but you can trust this crowd to be different.
Haven’t you heard anything about the
fuss?”</p>

<p>The shrill-voiced freshman shook her head
sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, of course it’s a dead secret,” the
other went on, “but my roommate is an intimate
friend of Miss Eastman’s. They asked
her to join them, but she decided not to. She
told me because she was just dying to talk it
over with somebody. That was away back
last week. It’s leaked out more now, so I’m
sure there’s no harm in my telling you. Of
course everybody will know Saturday night
when they don’t appear.”</p>

<p>“Do go on,” begged the other.</p>

<p>At this point Betty, who scorned eavesdropping,
made an errand to the kitchen. As
early as possible that evening she went up to
the Belden. Polly’s room was dark, but Betty
found the “Why-Get-Ups” gathered in full
force in Georgia’s corner single. Their greetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
were constrained, and they plunged at
once into a lively discussion of the last number
of the “Argus,” which had come out that
afternoon.</p>

<p>But Betty refused to delay. “I’ve come on
business,” she announced. “I want to know
if your house dance is this Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I believe it is,” Polly admitted
casually, after a nudge from Lucille, “but
we’re not going. I told you we were sick of
weak lemonade and stupid partners. Have
you planned our three courses?”</p>

<p>Betty turned upon Georgia. “Why are
you all cutting your own house dance?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>Georgia grinned sociably. “Bored,” she
explained briefly. “Dying for excitement.
Pining for novelty. Ask Madeline: she understands
the feeling.”</p>

<p>“But she wouldn’t do this kind of thing,”
protested Betty. “It’s so conspicuous. You
needn’t have filled out your cards,&mdash;Madeline
never would,&mdash;but you ought to go. And you
certainly ought not to have an affair of your
own that night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell her all about it,” put in Fluffy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>Dutton. “I never thought it was fair not to.
She isn’t a faculty, but she’s a public institution.
She ought to go into this with her
eyes open. Besides when she’s heard the
whole story, I’m sure she’ll stand for us.
Mrs. Hinsdale couldn’t, of course. I only
hope that prep. school-teacher Alice is going
to ask for chaperon won’t be too curious or
too conscientious. Fire away, Lucile.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;&mdash;” Lucile paused. When you
came to tell it to an outsider there wasn’t so
much of a case as there had seemed to be when
they discussed it hotly among their injured
selves. “Well,” repeated Lucile, “to begin
with, we’d all asked men, except Georgia, and
she’d asked a prep. girl. And then Dickie
Garrison&mdash;she’s house president&mdash;went and
made rules against them. At least there had
always been a rule against men, but everybody
smuggled them in just the same and danced
with them too, up in the gallery. But Dickie
said to cut it out. We wouldn’t have cared,
only we were sure she knew about our men
and had cooked up this plot at the last minute
just to spite us. We aren’t very popular
with Dickie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“And then they ruled out asking prep.
girls,” put in Georgia.</p>

<p>“And finally Dickie came to me,” Fluffy
took up the tale of woe, “and said what
would I think of the next house-meeting’s
taking up the matter of lights after ten.
That was just insulting&mdash;to say to me.”</p>

<p>“So then we decided to&mdash;to revolt,” ended
the silent, straight-haired Dutton twin.
“There’s no rule against giving an off-campus
party, with men invited. Nobody
ever had one before that we know of, because
nobody ever thought of it. So we’ve just
kept dark to avoid possible fusses.”</p>

<p>“And if we can only get the chaperon
business settled, it’s all right,” added Lucile.
“Isn’t it now, Betty? We’ve asked six
Hilton House juniors to come too, and I’ve
invited a lot of extra men.”</p>

<p>“Including a light-haired one for me,” explained
Polly gaily, “according to the prophecy
of the seeress Madeline.”</p>

<p>There was a strained little silence.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Betty bravely at last,
“you don’t remember when the prom. began.
It was in my sister Nan’s senior year, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>I’ve heard her tell how it was started on purpose
to give the girls one good chance to have
their men friends up all at once and avoid
just this kind of thing. It was against the
rules then to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s not now,” declared Lucile hotly.</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you ask one of the
faculty to chaperon you?” Betty asked in a
queer, frightened voice, for she hated to interfere
or to seem priggish.</p>

<p>“Why indeed?” Georgia echoed. “Just
what Mary Brooks Hinsdale asked us. She
said she guessed it was all right, but a
faculty’s wife couldn’t do anything reckless.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want us, Betty, we can take
the down-town hall,” Lucile explained coldly.
“Only we depend on your sense of honor not
to give us away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross, Lucile,” commented the
straight-haired twin. “Betty’s not that sort.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled a thank you, and rose to go.
“I don’t know what to say to-night about the
loft,” she said, “but I’ll let you know the
first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>Directly after chapel next day the straight-haired
twin appeared, frankly apologetic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>“The prep, teacher turned us down too,” she
said, “and Georgia plucked up courage to ask
the new math. assistant, and she turned us
down. We don’t know any town women. We
wish&mdash;Fluffy and I do anyway&mdash;that we had
told our men about the new rule and asked
girls instead. This sort of thing is too much
like work.”</p>

<p>Betty considered an instant. She had intended
to consult Madeline, but Madeline had
overslept that morning. “Tell the girls that
if they’ll put it off till next Saturday they
may have it here, and that I’ll find a
chaperon myself.”</p>

<p>“You angel!” cried the twin. “Lucile
won’t like it because it won’t spite Dickie, so
particularly, if you don’t have it the night of
the Belden House affair, but the rest will
jump at your magnificent offer. Betty, will
you come to the regular house dance with me?”</p>

<p>As soon as she had received official notice
that her proposal was accepted Betty went
straight to Miss Ferris and explained the
whole thing, as she understood it, from
Georgia’s candid statement of motives to the
Dutton twins’ admission of regret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“But Lucile and Polly are so proud,” she
added. “If they had to give it all up now
they’d only go ahead and think up something
sillier to do. So I thought if you’d
chaperon it, and they promised not to boast of
it&mdash;&mdash; They’re all going to the house dance
now, except maybe Lucile, and most of the
few girls who know about their first plan will
think it’s given up. So it will create a lot less
talk and excitement than if I’d made them find
another place, and they’d telegraphed for one
of their mothers and had their party this week
Saturday, in spite of everything, as they first
planned.”</p>

<p>Miss Ferris smiled at her. “That sounds
like good logic. I’ll come; but suppose we
don’t tell them who the chaperon is to be until
they come to their dance.”</p>

<p>To arrive at what one has supposed to be a
secret and forbidden entertainment and to find
the head of the philosophy department waiting
smilingly to receive you and your friends&mdash;well,
it makes you feel at once foolish and
relieved. The “Why-Get-Up” party was
an undoubted success, but Georgia Ames told
Miss Ferris that they were all ashamed of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Because when you mean to be mean, why,
it’s not your fault if Betty switches you off
the track. Of course we all knew that we
weren’t up here to be giving man-dances.
We’ll stand by you, Miss Ferris, any way we
can.”</p>

<p>The “Why-Get-Up-to-Breakfast Club” stood
by Georgia’s promise. It paid to humor their
little whim, if only because Fluffy Dutton’s
light was out at ten for the rest of the year,
and Lucile Merrifield’s chapel attendance was
perfect. As for the Tally-ho Tea-Shop, it had
never seemed like the other places of its kind
in town, but now more than ever its unofficial
connection with the college was noted and
commented upon.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything that girl can teach?”
the president asked, when he heard about the
“Why-Get-Up” party. “We’ll have to find
something to keep her here indefinitely. She
knows how to make things run.”</p>

<p>But all Betty cared about was that the
“Why-Get-Ups” were one and all on the same
friendly and easy-going footing with her as
ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">A SEA OF TROUBLES</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thayer’s</span> month having been much
shortened by his tremendous energy, the factory
classes were successfully started, and Babbie,
with her tantalizing fashion of appearing
haughtily distant one minute and amazingly
friendly the next, was off for the gay Southern
resorts that she professed to hate. At some
one of them, Mr. Thayer was morally certain,
his fascinating cousin Austin would make it a
point to find her. White flannels, he reflected
glumly, were notably becoming to Austin’s
style.</p>

<p>Eugenia’s three weeks were nearly gone too,
and the lost theme had not come to light.
Betty had questioned every one who could possibly
have seen it or taken it from her desk,
and she had hunted through the tea-shop from
the remotest corner of the loft to the shed
where the kerosene can was kept. Poor Eugenia
had turned her room topsyturvy on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>three separate occasions, on the principle of
“three times and out,” and she had begged all
her friends to do likewise with theirs, if they
loved her one little bit. She had passed her
midyears, and was doing her best with all her
courses, though she sadly declared it was no
use at all, since Miss Raymond had never believed
she wrote her theme and would certainly
not give her another chance.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I blame her,” sighed
Eugenia, “only I think she might know that
if I was going to make up a lie I’d have made
up a better one than that. If I have to take
that course over in the ‘flunked-out’ class that
she’s organizing to begin next week, I shall
d-die. Just think of writing a lot of extra
themes on top of everything else&mdash;in spring
term too, that you all say is so lovely, when
nobody expects so terribly much of you. She’ll
expect more of you, Miss Wales!” ended Eugenia
vindictively.</p>

<p>Betty did not dare to hold out any encouragement,
but she secretly suspected that Miss
Raymond was keeping Eugenia on tenterhooks,
as good discipline, until the last minute,
and then meant to let her off easily. Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>couldn’t bear to consider the other alternative;
she should always have to feel partly responsible
for Eugenia’s misery. The fact that Eugenia
assured her sweetly that she wasn’t at
all responsible and kept on doing nice things
for Dorothy only made it all the harder.</p>

<p>And then came Emily Davis, a little pale
and worn with work done under difficulties
and with worry over the future, but as gay as
ever at heart. She slipped in upon Betty unannounced
one snowy afternoon.</p>

<p>“Indade an’ you’re a sight for sore eyes,”
she cried, rushing at her with a kiss and a hug.
“And it’s destroyed I am for a talk wid ye an’
a sup o’ your lovely tay.”</p>

<p>Emily’s Irish had been a prime favorite with
19&mdash;, and Betty laughed with delight at hearing
it again. “Poor lady, did you have a horrid
trip up?” she asked, as she rang her little
bell for Nora.</p>

<p>“Distressin’, me darlint, distressin’,” Emily
went on solemnly. “What wid cryin’ childern
an’ worritin’ wimin, wakin’ the place wid
their noise, I could nayther&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned Betty. “Here comes Nora.”</p>

<p>But she was just too late. Nora had overheard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
the mimicry of her race’s speech. Her
Irish feelings were hurt, and her Irish temper
kindled. When Betty introduced Emily and
explained that she had come to share the responsibilities
of the tea-room, Nora tossed her
head and said, “Yes’m, and is that all you
wanted?” with an air of an offended duchess.</p>

<p>She served the tea with great care, but in a
haughty silence that worried Betty and amused
Emily.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell her that I’m sorry?” she asked
Betty. “Or would that only make matters
worse?”</p>

<p>Betty was afraid it would, and promised to
explain herself, if Nora gave her an opening,
which Nora did with a vengeance the minute
Emily had gone off to hunt for a boarding-place
and see her old friends.</p>

<p>“I’ll be going, when my week is up,” she
announced briskly.</p>

<p>Betty stared. “Oh, Nora, you wouldn’t
leave me&mdash;just when I need you most, too, to
make the dinners go off splendidly, as I know
you can. What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll like taking orders from
the new lady&mdash;I forget her name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you think that, Nora?” Betty
threw out as a feeler.</p>

<p>“She’s not my idea of a lady, Miss Betty,
if you’ll excuse me saying it out. I’m sorry
to go an’ leave you in the lurch, Miss, but I
should always be feeling bothered whenever
she was by, and when you’re bothered you
can’t do your work right. So this is a
week’s notice, ma’am.”</p>

<p>In vain Betty explained that Emily had
meant no harm by her imitation. In vain
she argued, pleaded, coaxed, and scolded;
Nora was firm. She had given her week’s
notice, and in a week she would go.</p>

<p>Emily was “destroyed” in earnest when
she heard the news; the feeling that she had
repaid Betty’s kindness with careless trouble-making&mdash;or
perhaps it was more the reaction
from the strain of wondering what was ahead
of her&mdash;combined with a bad cold to send
her to bed for a few days. With all her
helpers gone, Betty found it very hard to
find time to hunt for a new waitress. In
spite of alluring advertisements and diligent
search by herself and her ever-faithful allies,
Mary and Georgia, no substitute for Nora was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>forthcoming. But Belden-House-Annie, who
had no sympathy whatever with her sister
Nora’s “flighty ways,” had sent word by
Lucile, who told Georgia, who told Betty,
that she had heard of somebody who might
do, and that the somebody aforesaid would
come to see Betty that same afternoon.</p>

<p>So Betty sat waiting for her, watching the
hands of the clock that went round much too
fast, considering that the waitress did not
come, until the door opened, and her hopes
took a sudden bound and then dropped dead.
It wasn’t a waitress. It was a gentleman.
He looked like the kind who would think
the tea was cold and the cakes stale, and he
would very likely be right too. Nora had
grown very careless since she had decided to
leave. Betty fervently wished that he had
not come, but she went forward, with her
cordial little smile, to meet him, where he
stood staring uncertainly around the room.</p>

<p>“Did you want some tea?” she asked
timidly. “Because if you’ll sit down&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The gentleman looked her over closely.
“Tea? Why, yes, I suppose I want tea. It’s
the thing to want at this hour, isn’t it? You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>do a pretty big business here, don’t you?”
He glanced toward the stalls, where groups of
girls were gathered.</p>

<p>“Yes, a good many people come,” Betty
told him pleasantly. “Would you like a little
table in the window or one near the fire?”</p>

<p>He chose one near the fire, overlooking the
whole room. He ordered nothing but a cup
of tea, which he sipped and sipped, while he
stared at the girls who came in and at those
who went out, at the china, the decorations,
the names over the stalls. These last appeared
to interest him particularly, and he
craned his neck until Betty feared it would
break, to decipher the one at the furthest
end of the line.</p>

<p>Finally he got up and strolled over to her
desk.</p>

<p>“Nice little place you’ve got here,” he said,
staring hard at her, with his sharp ferret-eyes.
“Very pretty decorations and all that.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Betty politely. “I’m
glad you like it. We’ve tried to make it look
attractive.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;er&mdash;the owner or manager or something
of that kind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>Betty explained her position briefly, wondering
why she hated so to talk to him.</p>

<p>“And do people drink enough afternoon
tea to pay your partners good profits on their
investment?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Betty hesitated. Certainly a stranger had
no right to pry into the Tally-ho’s private
affairs in this cool fashion, and yet, since
they were doing well, what harm could there
be in saying so? “We serve lunches as well
as tea, you know,” she explained tentatively,
“and next week we shall begin to serve dinners.”</p>

<p>Just then Lucile Eastman and a crowd of
her friends, who had been occupying the stall
named after Black Beauty, bore down upon
Betty’s desk, laughing and chattering over
their bill, which was to have been divided
because the party was a “Dutch treat,” but
which Nora had put all together by mistake,
and summarily refused to change.</p>

<p>“Now jam is twenty cents,” Lucile was explaining,
“and toast with cheese is fifteen,
and not a single one of us had the right
change. Please help us to get it right, Betty
dear. Now you go first, Polly. You had
sandwiches, and they’re twenty cents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>Betty got them all straightened out at last,
and by that time the party in Flying Hoof’s
stall had finished too. But the gentleman,
who had been fairly swept aside by the crowd
of hurrying girls, waited patiently enough
until they had gone, and then returned to
Betty and the interrupted conversation.</p>

<p>“Well,” he began briskly, “I suppose you
wouldn’t be branching out if you weren’t
pretty prosperous.”</p>

<p>In spite of her annoyance, Betty smiled at
his persistence. “I suppose not,” she admitted.
“We have a gift department too.”
She pointed to the table. “It’s pretty nearly
stagnated ever since Christmas, but a new
specialty for it, that we hope everybody will
buy, will be here very soon. We’re taking
orders now, from this sample.” She held out
the ploshkin for him to see.</p>

<p>The gentleman shook his head scornfully.
“None of that tomfoolery for me, thank you.
But there’s money in it&mdash;I know that. Here’s
ten cents for my tea. And here’s my card.”</p>

<p>Betty stared blankly from the bit of paste-board
he had handed her to the gentleman
whose name it bore. He was smiling a queer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>disagreeable smile, as if, for some reason that
she could not guess, he found her very amusing.
When he had made sure that his name
meant nothing to her, his smile widened.</p>

<p>“Don’t know who I am, eh? Got to feel
pretty much at home in this barn, haven’t
you? Feel a good deal as if you owned it,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>Betty failed to see the connection between
his first question and the other; but then, all
his questions had been queer. “No,” she replied
steadily, “I don’t know who you are,
sir. I’m sorry, since you think I ought to.
I’m very stupid about names. We don’t own
this barn; we rent it. And&mdash;and I think I
must ask you not to question me any more
about our business. I am employed by the
others. I can’t see how anything I have told
you could do us any harm, but I don’t think
it’s at all businesslike for me to discuss my
employers’ affairs with you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll think differently when I
tell you that I’m the owner of this property,”
snapped the man defiantly. Betty gasped.
“Thought I was in Italy, didn’t you?” He
grinned at her cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Betty nodded. “In Europe somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Thought my agent was an easy mark,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“He has always treated us very fairly and
politely”&mdash;Betty rushed indignantly to the
agent’s defense&mdash;“and I don’t see how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Fairly and politely.’” The man, whose
card read Mr. James Harrison, repeated the
words jeeringly. “Well, my agent’s got to do
more than treat young ladies ‘fairly and
politely,’ I can tell you, to suit me. Do you
know what the repairs on this place cost me?”</p>

<p>Betty had no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison named a sum. “I suppose
you do know what rent you pay?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Betty with great dignity.
“We’ve never been late with it so far.”</p>

<p>“You pay by the month. You’ve no contract&mdash;no
lease. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;y-yes,” Betty admitted doubtfully.
“I supposed that as long as we paid our rent
and didn’t injure your property, we could
stay.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you can stay,” he told her
affably, “only I’m going to raise the rent.
The rent you pay is ridiculous. From the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>beginning of next month just multiply it by
three, please.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but we can’t afford to pay as much
as that,” Betty told him. “That’s why we
didn’t start in New York&mdash;because rents were
so high. The first thing we asked your agent,
before we even came to look at this place, was
the amount of the rent.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison looked at her coldly. “Well,
he was an idiot, that’s all. I’m not in the
real estate business for my health. This barn
never paid decent returns. Now that we’ve
found a use for it, there’s no reason why it
shouldn’t. Think it over. Make up your
mind to cut down expenses and profits; and
if you should decide to quit, why, I’ll buy out
your fixtures. I’ll warrant I can rent at my
own price within a month.”</p>

<p>Betty had been thinking desperately. “I
don’t know very much about business, Mr.
Harrison,” she said at last, “but it seems to
me that if we pay rent by the month we
ought to have a full month’s notice that you
have decided to raise the price. A maid who
is paid by the week always gives at least a
week’s notice, and if we wanted to leave we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>should certainly have told your agent at least
a month beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said briskly. “This is the
twenty-third. Next month goes at the old
rate; after that multiply it by three or quit.
Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon,” Betty told him, with a
sigh of relief that he had gone, even though
he left such a dreadful ultimatum behind
him. But he hadn’t gone. He stuck his
head in the door to say that he would “call
around again” in a few days for her decision.</p>

<p>Left alone at last Betty looked at her
watch. Six o’clock&mdash;Belden-House-Annie’s
waitress wouldn’t come now. Perhaps it was
just as well. Perhaps Nora would stay for
the month&mdash;the last month of the Tally-ho.
They couldn’t pay three times their present
rent. No matter how successful the dinners
were, that was out of the question. The profits,
outside of the gift department, had been
comparatively small, and the busiest part of
the year was now over. If Mr. Harrison persisted
in his determination to raise the rent,
they would have to stop, or move&mdash;and there
was no place to move to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Betty looked around the pretty room, with
all its attractive “features,” and suddenly
realized what the closing of the tea-shop
would mean. Madeline and Babbie would be
disappointed; Mrs. Hildreth and Mrs.
Enderby would lose a part, at least, of their
investment. But she&mdash;and little Dorothy&mdash;and
Emily Davis&mdash;Betty reached out for a
sheet of note-paper to write to Madeline the
resourceful, and then dropped her head down
on the big desk and cried as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t she thought of all this before
Mr. Harrison left? She had, in a confused
fashion; but instead of helping her to argue
with him her despair had made her dumb.
If only he would let them stay until June!
Then Emily would be provided for through
the summer, and father and mother would be
back from Mexico. Dorothy could go home
and Betty too, with a nice little sum left over
to show for her winter’s work. But if the
Tally-ho stopped now, where could she sell
the ploshkins? And with the emergency
fund gone, and no salary after next
month&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Betty could hear father saying with his
twinkling, amused smile, “You oughtn’t to
have counted your chickens before they were
hatched, little girl. It’s a bad habit.”</p>

<p>But who would have thought that everything
could go to pieces now, after such a
splendid beginning?</p>

<p>Betty wiped her eyes and composed a telegram
to Madeline: “If possible countermand
order for ploshkins. Rent raised.
Will write.”</p>

<p>Then she reflected that a letter would reach
Madeline by the first mail in the morning,
and as she couldn’t countermand an order for
ploshkins before that time, a letter would do
as well as a telegram. But before she wrote
it she must go and have dinner with Dorothy.</p>

<p>She found Eugenia and Dorothy on the
floor playing paper-dolls, quite oblivious of
the fact that it was past dinner-time.</p>

<p>“I feel like a murderer the night before
he’s electrocuted,” Eugenia explained cheerfully.
“To-night I am enjoying myself, for
to-morrow I’ve got to go and tell Miss Raymond
that my lost theme is still lost. And
she’ll point with her awful finger to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>‘flunked-out’ class, and I shall accept my
doom.”</p>

<p>Dorothy tumbled over into Eugenia’s lap
and hugged her sympathetically. “Maybe
you’ll find it to-night,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re sure as sure you haven’t hidden
it?” Eugenia demanded solemnly.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then I think it’s in the bay of the ploshkin,”
Eugenia declared impressively, “and
that’s too far off to go to to-night, so I may as
well be off to dinner. By the way, Betty, I
want a dozen ploshkins out of the very first
that come.”</p>

<p>Instead of the pleased smile that Eugenia
had expected, Betty’s face wore a positively
tragic expression. “I’m not sure that we
shall have any to sell, Eugenia. There’s some
trouble. I can’t explain to-night. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Eugenia’s little face hardened as she listened
to Betty’s astonishing announcement. She
had not lost her ambition to take a place in
Harding’s charmed circle, and she had counted
on the ploshkin and her connection with it to
help her in becoming that envied and enviable
creature, a “prominent girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Madeline Ayres and Fluffy Dutton made
it, but it was Eugenia Ford’s idea”&mdash;that was
what she had looked forward to people’s saying.
And Polly Eastman was writing a song
called “The Bay where the Ploshkin Bides”
for Tibbie Ware, soprano soloist of the Glee
Club, to sing for her encore number at the
spring concert. There wouldn’t be point
enough to the song if there was only one
ploshkin. Being naturally silly and suspicious,
Eugenia now scented a deep-laid plot
against her happiness. Without stopping to
reason out the absurdity of her idea, she disentangled
herself from Dorothy’s caressing
arms.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to explain that,” she said.
“The only thing I really want explained is
where the theme I left on your desk went to.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>So that was what Eugenia really thought!
Betty sat very still wondering what would come
next.</p>

<p>“I’m homesick for my dear mother, Betty.”
Little Dorothy, awed by Eugenia’s coldness
and her beloved sister’s forbidding silence, was
very near to tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Betty held out her arms. “So am I,” she
said, and in a minute more the two sisters,
clasped tight in each other’s arms, were crying
out all their troubles. Betty came to her
senses first.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t be such sillies,” she told Dorothy,
with a watery attempt at a smile.
“Mother wouldn’t ever get homesick for
two such big cry-babies as we are. Now come
and let me bathe your face, and then we’ll go
right down to dinner. No, it’s too late. We’ll
go over to the tea-shop and cook a nice little
supper for ourselves. That will be lots of fun,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” agreed Dorothy faintly. “Can we
have strawberry jam?”</p>

<p>“All you want,” Betty promised, wishing
that she too was at the age when strawberry
jam could make her forget her woes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MYSTERY SOLVED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> found it very hard to keep her mind
on the preparations for supper. Dorothy’s
happy little babble of questions and frantic
efforts to “help” with everything, drove her
to the verge of distraction. Betty wanted
some crackers and coffee and a chance to write
to Madeline&mdash;Babbie had not yet sent any address,
and was, besides, too far away to help
much in the present crisis. But Dorothy insisted
upon creamed chicken on toast and hot
chocolate, and wished to treat strawberry jam
as an entrée and have “regular dessert” besides.
Betty acquiesced in all her demands not so
much from good-nature as because she was sure
that another flood of tears would come the
minute she said no. But she couldn’t make
ice-cream, which was Dorothy’s idea of “regular
dessert,” and not a bit had been left over
from the day’s sales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“Just remember how you love ‘whips,’”
she coaxed, and made one out of her share of
the cream for the chocolate.</p>

<p>Dorothy watched the proceedings suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, but a ‘whip’ always has jelly in the
bottom,” she objected.</p>

<p>Betty suggested using strawberry jam.</p>

<p>“Not that kind&mdash;real jelly. I shall be sick
of strawberry jam if I have it so much.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed despairingly, and then smiled.
“All right, we’ll turn it into charlotte russe,”
she said, “with this big slice of cake underneath.”</p>

<p>Dorothy wanted to know which was Charlotte&mdash;the
cake or the cream&mdash;and Betty
craftily encouraged the discussion, so that
little Dorothy would enjoy her dessert and not
notice that she was taking all the cream away
from Betty, which would have distressed her
dreadfully.</p>

<p>“And now we’ll pile the dishes up, and
Bridget will do them in the morning,” Betty
suggested, when they had finished.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s do them ourselves and s’prise
Bridget,” objected Dorothy, who was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
to surmise that Betty was in a hurry to
be rid of her. No matter how sleepy she
was, Dorothy never wanted to go to bed, and
to-night she was wide awake.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do them and surprise me?”
Betty asked. “I have a long, long letter to
write to Madeline, and I want to get
started, because I’m very tired and I thought
I’d like to go to bed when you do.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Dorothy, and Betty
lighted her desk-lamp and two candles, because
candle-light is so soothing and luxurious,
found a fresh sheet of paper to take the
place of the one that was still damp with
tears, and had gone as far as, “Dear Madeline,
I have some very bad news for you,”
when Dorothy fluttered back.</p>

<p>“I thought it all over,” she announced,
“and I thought it would be more of a s’prise
for Bridget if I didn’t do the dishes. She
can’t imagine what it is when she sees them
all piled up in her clean sink. But if I did
them, it wouldn’t s’prise you a bit, ’cause you
knew I was doing them.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now we’re all surprised,” said
Betty absently. “So you see if you can’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>think of something nice to do while I write
my letter.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you written it yet?” Dorothy
demanded, with an elaborate show of amazement.
“Well, now I’m the most s’prised one
of all! I thought I stayed out there ages-an’-ages.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled and went on writing, while
Dorothy stood staring disconsolately at her.</p>

<p>“It’s been ages-an’-ages now,” she declared
at the end of three minutes by the clock.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dorothy, do be quiet!” began Betty
impatiently. And then, as the smallest
sister’s lips quivered ominously, “Remember,
dearie, you’re my company, and a company
always helps along. This letter I’m writing
is on business about the tea-room, and you
can help me just lots by being nice and quiet
until I get it all written.”</p>

<p>Dorothy eyed her sister mournfully. “I
thought that when you had company come
to see you, you played what they wanted to,
and waited till they’d gone home to do what
you wanted to your own self. That’s what
m-mother always said.” Dorothy gulped
miserably over the “mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, that’s one kind of company,” Betty
explained patiently, “and you are that kind
of company too. But you said you wanted
to be the other kind&mdash;the kind brother Will
told you about, that people have to keep
them in business. And I told you you
might be, so we’re Betty Wales &amp; Co., aren’t
we?”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded solemnly. “That’s why I
help Nora clean the silver and put the menu
cards around on all the tables ’most every
day.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” Betty took her up
eagerly. “You help a lot&mdash;I couldn’t get
along at all without my dear little company.
But you’ll help the most you ever have if
you’ll be just as quiet as a little gray mouse
until I’ve finished my letter.”</p>

<p>Dorothy considered. “I might draw pictures,”
she suggested tentatively at last.</p>

<p>“Of course you might.” Betty handed
her a pencil and paper.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any good place to sit,”
Dorothy demurred. “I ought to have a
desk just as much as you.”</p>

<p>“Dorothy Wales,”&mdash;Betty’s voice was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>solemn,&mdash;“if I let you sit down here, will
you promise, ‘cross your heart,’ not to speak
another word until I’ve finished my letter?”</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded her head so vigorously
that her hair ribbon came off and had to be
tied on again. Then she established herself
at the desk, and Betty lighted more candles
and moved her writing materials into the
stall of Jack of Hearts. The big room was
still, save for the scratching of Betty’s pen
and an occasional loud “ahem” from Dorothy
whose throat was always affected queerly
in church or anywhere else where she was
denied the joys of fluent conversation.</p>

<p>As Betty wrote, the hopelessness of the
situation grew clearer and clearer. It seemed
a waste of words to explain it all, when there
was absolutely nothing to be done.</p>

<p>“What do girls know about business, anyway?”
Will had said that with his most
scornful air, when Betty had first proposed the
tea-room project. Well, he was right. A man
would have thought about a contract. A man
would have managed somehow to make out a
case in behalf of the Tally-ho. But how?
Betty went over the conversation, trying to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>think what she could have said, how she could
have answered Mr. Harrison’s questions so as
to defeat his plans. But she had no inspiration.
He was the owner of the barn. If he
wanted higher rent, he had a right to it. To
be sure, people sometimes wanted what they
couldn’t get. But he had said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I ought to have taken him up about that,”
Betty reflected sadly. “I ought to have asked
him if he was perfectly sure that any other
people would pay such a lot more than we
have. Madeline would have got him all confused
about it, and perhaps he’d have let us
stay.”</p>

<p>She went mournfully over the scene again
bit by bit.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wants our decorations
for,” she reflected. “They’re only good for a
tea-room. Then he must mean to use this for
a tea-room. But if he rents it all decorated,
of course it’s worth more. Why didn’t I think
to say that? Why didn’t I make him think
we would certainly go right on somewhere
else? He can’t steal our name and our ideas.
It’s not fair. Madeline must come and talk
to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>And she returned with new energy to her
letter, trying to make the case seem as urgent
as possible, and Madeline’s presence absolutely
necessary. Madeline was having a beautiful
time in Bohemia; Dick Blake had told her that
her stories were improving, and one of them
had actually been accepted by an obscure magazine
that “paid on publication.” Madeline had
celebrated this landmark in her Literary Career
by giving a dinner at Mr. Bob’s latest find
in the way of Italian cafés, and she had discovered,
over the coffee, that four of her six
guests had been honored by the same magazine,
and that all were still waiting patiently
for the years to bring around the mystic time
of publication.</p>

<p>“Who cares? It was a delicious dinner,
and just as much fun as if I had really arrived,”
Madeline had written Betty. “And
now the other four are all going to be game
and celebrate too.”</p>

<p>Betty realized how much persuasion it would
take to detach Madeline from four impending
celebrations, and begged her with all the eloquence
she could command to come to the rescue
of the Tally-ho. She was just folding her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>letter when a queer little squeal from Dorothy
made her jump.</p>

<p>“I’m through now, Company,” she called,
“so you can chatter away as fast as you like.
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I opened the secret drawer all by myself,”
cried Dorothy in an excited treble. “Nobody
showed me. I just heard you and Madeline
and Miss Mary&mdash;I mean Mrs. Mary&mdash;talking
about how to do it. And I remembered, and
after I got tired of drawing pictures for magazines
I did it. Look!” and she danced over
to Jack of Hearts’ stall with the secret drawer
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Why, Dorothy Wales!” began Betty in
astonishment. “I don’t believe I could have
opened that myself. Why, there’s something
in it. What! Oh, Dorothy, you darling,
you’ve helped now, I can tell you! Why,
Dorothy Wales, do you know what you’ve
done? You’ve found Eugenia’s theme.”</p>

<p>“If you’d asked me I’d have found it before,”
announced Dorothy with dignity.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, little sister? Did you
hide away Eugenia’s theme in that drawer?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. But I’d have looked everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and when I came to this place, why
there I’d have seen it.”</p>

<p>“But Madeline and I looked there,” explained
Betty in perplexity, “and the drawer
was empty then. So if you haven’t put it in
there since, some one else has.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another paper,” said little Dorothy,
handing Betty a card. “What does it say? I
can’t read that queer kind of printing.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t the strangest thing!”
Betty quite forgot to tell Dorothy that the card
said, “Mrs. George Garrison Hinsdale, Thursdays.”
“Mary put that in there herself the
day she opened the drawer&mdash;I remember she
said we might lose the combination and then,
years after, her card would be found there, and
people would wonder what the things she
wrote on the back could mean. See: ‘Perfect
Patron, Promoter of Ploshkins, Candle-shades,
and Cousin Kate’s Cookies.’ And that card
most certainly wasn’t there either, when Madeline
and I had the drawer open hunting for
Eugenia’s theme.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t look very hard, I guess,” said
little Dorothy wisely. But Betty was over at
the desk, putting back the secret drawer with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>Mary’s card still in it. Then she went
through the combination, and when the
drawer came out it was empty again.</p>

<p>“Goodness, but this is funny!” she said,
shutting it in hurriedly. “But I think I see
how it happens. Now, Dorothy, you open
the drawer, please.”</p>

<p>And when Dorothy opened it, there was
the card. She had used the second combination
that Madeline had hit upon, and Betty
had used the first. There were two secret
drawers, only one of which could be opened
at a time. They were side by side, and it
took close inspection to notice the slight difference
in their positions. When Madeline
had shown Mary how to find the drawer she
had used the second combination, and it was
that drawer that had stayed open all day and
into which Eugenia’s ill-fated theme had
slipped. But when Madeline had looked for
the theme, she had happened to use the other
combination, and consequently had opened
the wrong drawer.</p>

<p>Betty hastily added a postscript to her letter:
“Eugenia’s theme is found. There are two secret
drawers in the desk, and it was in the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>Then she took Dorothy home, for it was
long past her bedtime, and mailed her letter,
which must reach Madeline without fail the
first thing in the morning, so as to give her
the earliest possible chance to countermand
the ploshkin order and get ready to start for
Harding. She reached the campus on her
other errand just in time to hear the college
clock toll out the last strokes of ten and to
see the shadow of the Belden House matron
and her candle stalk majestically down
the length of the lower hall. That meant
locked doors everywhere, so Betty went home
and to bed. She dreamed that Eugenia Ford
was throwing the Tally-ho dishes at Miss
Raymond, who was standing on a table pelting
Eugenia with handfuls of oats pulled
from the big horseshoe over the fireplace.
And through the door to the kitchen wound
a procession of little ploshkins, who hopped
along exactly as Billy and Willy Stocking
had at the Christmas party.</p>

<p>She woke up later than usual the next
morning with a queer feeling that something
unpleasant had happened. In a minute she
remembered, and resolved not to waste time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>in worry, but to get Eugenia’s theme to her
as soon as possible and then devote herself to
persuading Nora to postpone her departure a
little.</p>

<p>Eugenia received her with studied coldness.
She was “very much relieved” to have her
theme back. Perhaps Betty would explain
to Miss Raymond.</p>

<p>Betty was quite willing to do that. She
didn’t blame Eugenia for being vexed about
the theme and disappointed about the ploshkins.
She would have been, in Eugenia’s
place, no doubt; but when she asked Eugenia
if she should be down in the afternoon to see
Dorothy, and Eugenia replied coldly that she
was very busy, and never even sent a message
of thanks to the little girl for finding the
missing theme&mdash;then Betty was vexed in
her turn. Dorothy wasn’t to blame for any
of Eugenia’s troubles. It would be just as
sensible for Miss Raymond to be disagreeable
to her because her desk had two secret drawers.</p>

<p>But Miss Raymond was very friendly and
very much interested in the two drawers,
which she promised to come and see for herself
soon. And Nora, won by the suspicion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>of tears in Betty’s eyes and by the honor of
being entrusted with Betty’s unhappy secret,
promised to stay a few days longer, until
Madeline had come up and they knew how
matters stood.</p>

<p>Madeline arrived that very afternoon.</p>

<p>“Show me the drawers,” she demanded before
she was well inside the Tally-ho, and to
Betty’s dismay she utterly refused to talk
business, while she sat for an hour opening
one drawer after another, and hunting
through the recesses of the desk for more
sliding panels or hidden springs.</p>

<p>“For if there are two drawers, there may
just as well be three or even four,” she said.
“And who knows what may be in them or
how long they’ve been lost and forgotten?
Don’t look so disgusted, Betty. I ordered
the ploshkins the first day I was in New
York, and this morning it was too late to
change. To-morrow I’ll hunt up your dreadful
Mr. Harrison and try my blarney on him,
though after the way you managed Dick
Blake for Eleanor when we were sophomores,
I don’t see how you expect me to succeed
where you’ve failed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“This was so unexpected,” Betty explained.
“He frightened all my ideas away,
because he came at me so suddenly. I’m
never any good at impromptus.”</p>

<p>Madeline sighed. “And that’s all I am
good for. Now I may struggle over this
drawer business for hours and find nothing,
and then some day, when I’m not trying, I
shall just put my hand out and snap the
right spring. It’s horribly provoking&mdash;gives
you such a lazy, purposeless feeling at times.”</p>

<p>Evidently Madeline didn’t care much
about the disaster that threatened the
Tally-ho. She could sit and play with an
old-fashioned desk, not asking a question
about all the matters that Betty had not
taken time to write of fully, nor making a
single plan for the campaign against Mr.
Harrison. Well, if she believed so thoroughly
in her impromptu inspirations, why
should she bother with making plans? If
she only would act as if she cared a little&mdash;as
if she realized what the failure of the tea-room
meant to Betty. But she only played
with the drawers, and gave absurd accounts
of the Literary Celebrations. The next one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>was to be a roller-skating party, and not one
of the crowd had ever been on roller-skates
before.</p>

<p>“But the first one whose story is printed is
going to reimburse the rest of us for the doctors
and the liniments we expect to need,”
Madeline explained, “and Bob Enderby has
solemnly promised to ask the editor of ‘The
Leisure Hour’ to come and meet his near-contributors.
It’s to-morrow night. Now
say I’m not businesslike if you dare, to come
straight up here and miss it all.” Then she
laughed. “I may as well ’fess up that it was
only the postscript about the secret drawer
that brought me. But that doesn’t matter,
does it? Because now that I’m here, I shall
do my full duty by Mr. Harrison.”</p>

<p>But the next morning Madeline came back
in dismay from her visit to Mr. Harrison’s
Harding office.</p>

<p>“He’s away,” she lamented. “The agent
was there, and I talked to him; but he can’t
do anything. He’s in deep disgrace now for
letting us have so many repairs. And Mr.
Harrison won’t be back for at least a week;
so you’ll have to tackle him yourself after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Madeline, can’t you stay over?”</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head decisively. “Absolutely
impossible. I’ve just hired a studio
apartment consisting of two closets, miscalled
rooms, and I’ve begun a novel. It was spinning
along like mad when you stopped it. I
should have to go to-morrow anyway, so why
not go now, in time for the roller-skating
party? I did want to stay long enough to
find the other secret drawers, though.” Madeline
frowned absently at the old desk.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there aren’t any others,” Betty
reminded her practically.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m sure there are. I have a
leading.” Madeline stretched out her hand,
and, just as she had predicted, it hit the
spring. A fan-shaped panel slipped to one
side, the wall at the back of the opening
dropped, and a tiny drawer, deep and very
narrow, appeared, the small key still in the
lock.</p>

<p>“There!” said Madeline triumphantly,
opening it. “Oh, it’s stuffed full! Betty
Wales, these are love-letters, I just know it!
Tied with pink ribbons and scented with lavender.
Did you ever imagine anything so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>nice? It’s surely all right to read them, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we ought to take them to the
woman you bought the desk of,” Betty suggested.</p>

<p>“But her husband had just taken it for a bad
debt, and I remember she said all the family it
really belonged to had died or moved away.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess it’s all right, so long as
they’re so very old.”</p>

<p>They were love-letters, the sweetest, merriest
letters to a girl named Patricia from a man
who signed himself “R.” One or two of Patricia’s
notes to “R.” were tucked in with the
letters, but as they all began “Mine,” they
threw no light on the significance of the “R.”
Betty liked that; it added to the sense of remoteness,
to the story-book atmosphere of
“long-ago and far-away” that belonged to the
yellowed sheets, the faded ribbons, and the
quaint, old-fashioned expressions. Most of the
letters had never been mailed. Madeline almost
wept with joy when she discovered that
they had been put in a hollow tree in Patricia’s
apple orchard. They were arranged by
dates and once there was a gap of six months.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>That was because the squire of the village had
asked Patricia’s father for his daughter’s hand
in marriage, and Patricia’s father had said yes.
Patricia was an obedient child, so there were
no more letters in the tree, in spite of “R.’s”
pleadings, until one day when Patricia could
show good reason for sending the squire about
his business. And then there was a duel. Was
it between “R.” and the squire, or “R.” and
some other disappointed suitor? They were
still discussing the evidence when Madeline
remembered her train.</p>

<p>“Let me take these along,” she begged.
“I’ll send them back in a day or so, but I
simply must know how it all ended.” She
turned to the desk. “There ought to be a
drawer on the other side to correspond to this
one.”</p>

<p>“Let me try to find it,” cried Betty hastily,
and after a minute’s fumbling she snapped the
spring. “It’s getting almost tiresome, finding
so many secret hiding-places, isn’t it?” she
laughed.</p>

<p>This drawer was full too, but of dusty,
uninteresting-looking documents. Madeline
glanced them through rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing exciting there, I guess. You can
look them over, and if they’re about Patricia
and ‘R.’ send them to me, won’t you? And
if you hate talking to Mr. Harrison, get Emily
to go for you, or send Young-Man-Over-the-Fence.
He’d like nothing better than to
champion the cause of oppressed damsels,
Babbie Hildreth being one of them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t take this seriously enough,
Madeline,” Betty told her sadly.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Madeline, “I don’t, but that’s
because I have such perfect confidence in your
persuasive powers. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The whistles shrieked for noon. Betty hastily
straightened up her desk, gave some last
touches to the dainty tables, and resolutely
forced a smile to meet the usual twelve-o’clock
invasion of hungry customers. Never in her
life had she felt so forlorn and lonely, but she
was too proud to show it. She resolved that if
the Tally-ho Tea-Shop must be abandoned at
least it should go out in a blaze of glory. At
first she had not thought it worth while to
begin the dinner service for only a month,
but now she decided to inaugurate it at once.
She hung up the prettily lettered signs that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>Madeline had made: “Beginning to-morrow
the Tally-ho Tea-Shop will serve dinners,
and will therefore be open until nine in the
evening.” The appearance of this announcement
created no little excitement. Six
girls ordered special dinners for the opening
night. Eugenia Ford sent a written order
by a friend who came in for tea. She explained
that she wanted everything “as elegant as
possible,” because her dinner was in honor of
her roommate’s mother and father&mdash;“very
wealthy people.” She hoped the waitress
would wear a cap. As caps were Nora’s bête
noir, Betty decided to ask the newest Student’s
Aid waitress if she would mind wearing one
just this time, by way of helping to heap coals
of fire on Eugenia’s pretty head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">A MAGNATE TO THE RESCUE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily Davis</span> had expected to go to work
the day that the dinners began, but when she
tried her strength she found it much less than
she had thought. She sat at the cashier’s desk
until two o’clock, and then Betty, noticing
how pale and miserable she looked, insisted
on her giving up and going home to rest.</p>

<p>“I’ll manage some way,” she assured her
new assistant hopefully. “And you’ll most
certainly catch your never-get-over if you sit
here with all the draughts blowing on you,
when you’re not well enough to be up.”</p>

<p>“A stove doesn’t give a very even heat,
does it?” said Emily wanly. “I’m warm all
but one side.”</p>

<p>“A stove,” said Betty with feeling, “is a
relic of the barbaric ages. So are kerosene
lamps. Running this place without the
stove and the lamps would be simply blissful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>I should feel like a robber when I took my
salary.”</p>

<p>“You shall have a chance to feel that way
just as soon as I begin to earn mine,” Emily
assured her. “I hate to leave you to-day,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Run along,” Betty broke in. “I shall
need you a lot more after Nora is gone.”</p>

<p>But her resolute hopefulness turned to
blank dismay when the newly engaged
waitress, who had seemed so promising, sent
word that she had sprained her ankle.
Nora’s regular assistant was a stout, stupid
girl, who could be trusted only with simple
orders and unexacting customers. Betty
went over the names of the girls who had engaged
stalls, found no unexacting ones among
them, promptly arrayed herself in one of the
caps that Nora scorned and an apron, sent the
stupid waitress after a stupid friend who
could probably make change correctly, and
planned a division of work with Nora, who
was frankly horrified at her mistress’s new
rôle.</p>

<p>“But the first night must be a success,
Nora,” Betty explained. “I’ll stay in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>kitchen getting orders ready for Mary Jones
as long as I dare. But when she begins to
look wild-eyed and distracted, I shall put her
in the kitchen, and come out myself. It’s
the only way to have things go off well.”</p>

<p>By half-past six the tea-shop was crowded.
Betty, peeping in through the kitchen door,
was relieved to find very few of her particular
friends among the diners. She hoped
that nobody would exclaim over her new departure
or stop her to demand explanations.
She had a presentiment that if any one did
she was going to feel, as Nora declared she
ought, “most awful queer.”</p>

<p>Eugenia’s arrival occurred at an unlucky
moment, when Nora was too busy to attend
to her, and Betty decided that her time had
come. After the first plunge, past Eugenia’s
blank, unrecognizing stare and through a
little flurry of amused nods and puzzled
glances from other girls who knew her, it
wasn’t so bad. Except Eugenia’s party, nobody
who gave her orders neglected to hail
her and condole over Emily’s grippe and the
new waitress’s ankle. Betty soon got into
the spirit of the occasion, thoroughly enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
everything but the many trips to
Eugenia’s stall, with its hedge of pompous
dignity. She was on her way out to the
kitchen with a big trayful of dishes, when the
door opened and in strode an elderly gentleman,
with a militant air and keen gray eyes
that twinkled merrily under his bushy eyebrows,
as he closed the door with a terrific
bang and looked eagerly about him from one
absorbed group of diners to another. But a
man is a novelty in Harding, and this particular
man would have attracted attention anywhere;
in an instant he was the centre of interest;
in another he had discovered Betty
and she had discovered him.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss B. A.!” he called out gleefully,
quite oblivious of the staring crowd of
girls. “Put down that tray and come and
shake hands. Didn’t expect to see me to-night,
did you? Well, I was almost up here,
and I’d promised myself that some time this
winter I’d investigate Harding College, so I
seized the opportunity. I telegraphed the
little tomboy that John’s so fond of to meet
me and help show me around. Haven’t seen
her, have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, Mr. Morton,” Betty told
him&mdash;for of course the noisy intruder was
none other than Jasper Jones Morton, the
Elusive Magnate of the European trip.
“And I’m afraid she won’t come, because I
had a letter from her yesterday saying that
she was in bed with a cold.”</p>

<p>Jasper J. Morton’s smile clouded. “Too
bad, too bad,” he muttered. “She’ll be disappointed.
She likes going off on trips with
me. We’ll have to send her a consolation
present to-morrow. You’ll know what she’d
like. Now, Miss B. A., I want some dinner at
this famous tea-shop, and I want you to sit
down and eat with me and tell me all about
the business.” Mr. Morton threw back his
head and laughed, as if he thought Betty
Wales in business at the Tally-ho Tea-Shop
the very best joke in the world.</p>

<p>Betty led him to a little table in a corner,
that had opportunely been left vacant by two
girls who were hurrying off to a senior play
rehearsal. “But I can’t sit with you,” she
explained, “because I’m waiting on people
to-night. The regular waitress has sprained
her ankle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“There’s one.” Mr. Morton waved his hand
imperiously at Nora. “She can manage somehow.
Sit down.”</p>

<p>But Betty was firm. She explained that
the dinners were a new departure, that she
was particularly anxious for every one to go
away satisfied with the food and the service,
and finally she promised to wait on Mr.
Morton herself, and to come and talk to him
later, when the crowd had thinned. Then
she flew to the kitchen after Eugenia’s salads.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton watched her pick up the heavy
tray. “Bless me, but she’s a worker!” he
muttered audibly, to the vast amusement of
two freshmen at the next table. “I supposed
from what the little tomboy said that she
was playing at business, but it seems she’s in
earnest. How I do like to see people in
earnest!”</p>

<p>When Eugenia Ford had finished her
dinner, she intercepted Betty in a flying trip
to the kitchen after a forgotten cup of coffee.
“Isn’t that Mr. Jasper J. Morton of New
York?” she asked. “I thought it must be,
and so did Mr. and Mrs. Valentine, Susanna’s
mother and father. They know him very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>well, but of course he won’t expect to see them
here. Would you mind taking us over to
speak to him? Why didn’t you tell me you
knew the Mortons?”</p>

<p>“Why should I have told you that?” demanded
Betty calmly. “The subject never
came up. John Morton is engaged to one of
my best friends.”</p>

<p>“Really!” Eugenia’s face was a study.
“Well, come over and meet the Valentines.”</p>

<p>“Not till I’ve brought Dickie Drake’s coffee.
Just a second, Dickie.” And she was off. It
was a master-stroke on Betty’s part, to cap the
information about the Mortons by showing
her intimacy with Dickie Drake, who was a
most exclusive senior. It was one thing to
speak of her as Dickie&mdash;all the college did
that&mdash;and quite another to address her directly
by her nickname. But Betty was not trying
to impress Eugenia&mdash;which was the reason
why she succeeded so perfectly then and a
moment later, when, having been duly introduced
to the Valentines, she convoyed them
and Eugenia across to Mr. Morton’s table.</p>

<p>“Friends of yours, Miss B. A.?” he inquired
in a dreadfully loud whisper. “Friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>of mine! Nonsense&mdash;merest acquaintances.
Well, tell me their names again, and then
bring ’em along. How do you do, Mrs. Valentine?
Mr. Valentine, how are you? Your
daughter&mdash;this one, no, that one&mdash;and Miss
Force. Very glad to see so many New
Yorkers, I’m sure. Miss B. A., don’t forget
that I’m waiting for you. I hate to be kept
waiting, but you’re one of the people that are
worth waiting for. Do I know your father,
Miss Force? It’s quite possible. I know
so many people in one way and another that
it takes several secretaries to keep me posted
on the subject. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll
go back to my dinner, which is too good to
let cool.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the “very wealthy” Valentines
and “Miss Force” departed, and Jasper J.
Morton chuckled to himself as he wondered
if they had noticed that what he had left on
his plate to cool was tomato salad. He had
reached his coffee before Betty came to keep
him company. She wasn’t hungry, she explained;
she had snatched her dinner bit by
bit between-times; but Mr. Morton insisted
upon her beginning all over again and “eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
like a Christian,” telling her meanwhile
the latest news of John’s senior honors at
Harvard, of which he was absurdly proud, and
of the house he was building as a surprise for
Babe, next to his own stately summer home.</p>

<p>“Now tell me all about yourself,” he commanded,
when Betty finally declared that she
couldn’t and wouldn’t eat anything more.
“Are you well, and are you happy? It’s no
use asking if your business is a success, after
watching this evening’s crowd eat. But I’m
afraid you’re overworked. Next time you’re
shy a waitress just telephone me and I’ll have
one sent up from New York in short order.
But if she doesn’t get here soon enough, why,
let ’em sit a while. Or let ’em run out and
help themselves. The help-yourself style of
restaurant is getting to be very popular. Now
how about your latest ‘benevolent adventures’?”</p>

<p>Betty told him about the factory’s club-house,
and promised to take him to see it in
the morning, after they had been to chapel
and made a tour of the campus. Mr. Morton
watched her closely while she talked.</p>

<p>“You’re not happy, Miss B. A.,” he said at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>last. “You’ve got something on your mind.
You don’t laugh right out the way you did
last summer, and you were thinking about
something else while I told you about the little
tomboy’s new house. Out with it now;
what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Betty assured him.</p>

<p>“You say that very much as if you didn’t
mean it, my dear young lady,” Mr. Morton
told her.</p>

<p>“Well, nothing that I want to tell you
then,” Betty amended, with her flashing
smile. “You’ll want to do something about
it and I don’t think you can&mdash;anyway I don’t
want you to try, and you’ll only get awfully&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mad,” put in Mr. Morton grimly. “Well,
then you’ll have a chance to smooth me down
the way you did last summer. You can do
that, but you can’t get out of telling me what’s
worrying you.”</p>

<p>So Betty told the whole story, beginning
with Mr. Harrison’s unexpected visit and
ending with Madeline’s hurried one. She explained
why she had begun so suddenly with
the dinners, and how unfortunate it was that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>there would be no time to sell the ploshkins,
of whose charms she gave a lively description.
She accounted for her disappointment purely
on the ground of not wishing to have the
Tally-ho Tea-Shop cease at the height of its
success, saying nothing about the little sister,
her responsibility for Emily, or the low ebb of
her own finances. But just as she had predicted,
Mr. Morton flew into a rage at once.
Why hadn’t she written him to come and interview
that rascal Harrison? Why had she
gone into business in the first place without
his advice and help? Where was the scamp’s
office? If he did not meet his engagement to
go to chapel with her the next morning she
would know what had detained him.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Morton, Mr. Harrison isn’t in
town just now,” Betty expostulated, not
thinking it necessary to add that Mr. Harrison’s
absence was the chief reason why she
had not absolutely refused to confide in Mr.
Morton.</p>

<p>“That may be,” Mr. Morton sputtered,
“but he is somewhere on this side of the
globe, isn’t he? He hasn’t dropped off the
earth, and presumably he can be reached by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>wire or wireless, can’t he? You go to bed
and to sleep, Miss B. A. I’ll settle this scamp
Harrison.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Morton&mdash;&mdash;” Betty began, only
to be majestically waved into silence.</p>

<p>“I admire your independence. I always
admire independence. But in this case it’s
absurd. I won’t call this man Harrison a
scamp to his face, Miss B. A.; I give you my
word I won’t. But I’ll bring him to terms,
or my name’s not J. J. Morton. You see,
Miss B. A., in a case like this my name is a
pretty valuable asset. It will scare him a
good deal when he finds who’s back of this
tea-shop that he thought was run by a parcel
of little girls.”</p>

<p class="p2b">Next morning the chapel bell was tolling
and the last stragglers were hurrying up the
hill, hoping to slip in before the doors were
closed, when a carriage drove up to the
Tally-ho and Jasper J. Morton, descending
from it, beckoned wildly to Betty to come
out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo5"><img src="images/i_302.jpg" width="400" alt="THEY INTERCEPTED THE PRESIDENT"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">THEY INTERCEPTED THE PRESIDENT</p>

<p class="p2">“I don’t want to miss seeing this famous
chapel service,” he called, as Betty, who had
been watching for him by a window, appeared.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>“I’ve done your business, Miss B. A. I
routed out the agent, got this Harrison’s address,
and”&mdash;he chuckled reminiscently,&mdash;“in
three minutes by long distance the
whole thing was arranged. The rent and the
agent go on just as usual. The agent will
bring you a contract, made out for as long as
you like. There will be no rent this summer
while the place is closed for needed repairs.
Is this the right way to chapel? Come on
then.”</p>

<p>The portly form of Jasper Jones Morton
barely squeezed through the chapel door as it
slid shut, and he and Betty dropped breathlessly
into the back row of seats.</p>

<p>“I like to accomplish what I set out to,”
he murmured under cover of the opening
chant. “And I’d like to meet the president
of the college some time when it’s convenient.”</p>

<p>So they intercepted the president when
chapel was over, and the president insisted
upon personally conducting so distinguished
a financier as Jasper Jones Morton over his
domain. Jasper Jones Morton beamed upon
the president and upon every inch of the domain,
and he made ostentatious notes of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>president’s unostentatious hints regarding the
needs of the college.</p>

<p>He went over these later, as he devoured an
early luncheon by the fire in the Tally-ho.
“Now, shall I build them a library annex, or
a greenhouse, or a dormitory?” he demanded.
“I couldn’t give him any idea what to expect
until I’d seen you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could build a dormitory for
girls who can’t pay the regular price for
board,” said Betty impulsively. “They have
to live so far off and in such horrid little
places&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Mr. Morton cut her short.
“Don’t I know? Have I forgotten the holes
I’ve boarded in? Now of course I’ll put up
that kind of dormitory, with an endowment
to cover the expense of running it. You’ve
got nerve, Miss B. A. That gift will cost at
least twice what the others would.”</p>

<p>Betty only laughed, for she was very sure
that Mr. Morton did not care what his gift to
Harding cost. Besides she was too happy
about the Tally-ho’s rent to worry about anything
else.</p>

<p>“Now if you have that decided, please tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>me how you managed Mr. Harrison,” she
begged. “I may have to manage him some
time myself, when you’re too far away&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No you won’t,” Mr. Morton interrupted
with decision. “I have just one rule, Miss B.
A., for the treatment of scoundrels: Eliminate
them. I applied the rule this morning in the
simplest way that occurred to me, by buying
this property.”</p>

<p>“So you’re our landlord now!” gasped
Betty.</p>

<p>“I am,” Mr. Morton assured her. “Just as
soon as the college closes I want this tea-room
to close too, so that I can install decent up-to-date
systems of lighting and heating and make
any other improvements that you or the artistic
young lady named&mdash;thank you, yes, Ayres,
can suggest. Remember I hate half-way measures.
I want my building to be the finest
quarters for a tea-shop in the whole U.S. Then
I guess, when you are tired of running the
place&mdash;or I might say anxious to try your
hand at running some lucky young man&mdash;why,
you won’t have any trouble in finding a
successor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Morton,” sighed Betty reproachfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
“you shouldn’t have done it. Really
you shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You certainly didn’t encourage me at all,”
Mr. Morton told her, “so you needn’t feel in
the least responsible. By the way, send me a
sample of that plasher-thing that you’re having
made in plaster. If those fool images sell
here, I don’t see why they shouldn’t make
good in New York. And tell the president
what we’ve decided about the dormitory. Tell
him to write me if he favors the idea, and I’ll
send a check. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You must wait till I’ve thanked&mdash;&mdash;” began
Betty.</p>

<p>“Miss B. A.,” broke in Mr. Morton sternly,
“don’t you know me well enough yet to know
that the thing I detest most in this world is to
be thanked?”</p>

<span class="smaller">A ROMANCE AND A BURGLARY</span></h2></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Goodness</span>, but I’m glad I haven’t got to
break the news to you that I thought I must,”
Betty told Emily, when she appeared late in
the afternoon. And then she broke the good
news instead, and incidentally, now that the
danger was all over, explained how nearly the
tea-room had come to ruin. She was bursting
to tell Emily, who would especially appreciate
the idea, about the new dormitory; but the
president of Harding must be the first one to
hear that news. Betty left Emily in charge
of the desk and hurried up to the campus.
When she got back, after an altogether satisfactory
interview, she found Nora watching in
rapt admiration while Emily deftly mended a
three-cornered tear in the new blue silk skirt
that had been the pride of Nora’s heart.</p>

<p>“Shure an’ she’s a wonder with her needle,”
Nora informed Betty, and never a word more
did she say about her “notice.” It would indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
have been a callous person who could
bring herself to leave the Tally-ho Tea-Shop
just when something exciting was brewing
there all the time. First there was the news
of Jasper J. Morton’s munificent gift to the
college. The president passed it on at once,
so that almost before Betty was back at her
desk Lucile Merrifield rushed in to ask for all
the details.</p>

<p>“I hear you planned the whole thing,” she
said, “and we all think it’s perfectly splendid.
Why didn’t any one ever think of it before?”</p>

<p>Of course Betty disclaimed all credit for Mr.
Morton’s gift, but it was no use, especially
when his letter to the president was printed in
the local newspapers. He referred that gentleman
to Miss Wales “for any further ideas and
for detailed suggestions, since it was she who
first interested me in Harding College and who
originated this particular form of benefaction.”
Her real friends loved and respected her more
than ever for her power to bring such good
fortune to pass, and girls like Eugenia Ford
were immensely impressed by her evident intimacy
with the Mortons and her influence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>over a man who was noted for never taking
advice from anybody.</p>

<p>“It just happened that I got mixed up in
it,” Betty told Miss Ferris humbly. “But
I am glad that now, when I have the least to
give myself, some one that I know can do so
much. I’ve remembered all this year what
you told me last fall about helping in one way
if you can’t in another. It’s worked pretty
well.”</p>

<p>Just as the excitement about the dormitory
was subsiding, Madeline stirred things up
with a succinct telegram to Betty: “Arrived at
last.”</p>

<p>Lucile and Polly and the Dutton twins
happened to be breakfasting at the Tally-ho
when it came, and Betty passed it over to
them for opinions about its probable meaning.</p>

<p>“With her usual Bohemian extravagance
she pays for seven words that she doesn’t
send,” complained Lucile. “Let’s answer it,
girls. What shall we say?”</p>

<p>“Which way were you going?” suggested
Fluffy Dutton. “That’s to the point. And
send it ‘C. O. D.’ Then she’ll be more explicit
next time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“Not she,” objected Polly. “The charm
of her is that she doesn’t know the meaning
of explicitness. But we’ll send it ‘C. O. D.’
all the same, because we are all too poor to
pay.”</p>

<p>Polly had not anticipated Madeline’s
obvious revenge, which was to send a ninety
word reply, unpaid, and addressed to “Lucile-Polly-Fluffy-Georgia,
Belden House.” But
she was quick to see her way out of the financial
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Georgia didn’t do anything about sending
it, so she pays,” she decreed; and Georgia accepted
the decision with her customary bland
cheerfulness, only demanding in return the
ownership of the telegram, which would make
a beautiful trophy for her “memorabil,” as
the Harding girl calls her scrap-book filled
with souvenirs of her college days.</p>

<p>The telegram was certainly a work of art
and ingenuity, and it took art and ingenuity
to understand it, with no punctuation marks
and some words evidently invented by a despairing
operator in a quandary over Madeline’s
perfectly illegible handwriting. But
the general drift was that Madeline had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>“on the way to” utter despair,&mdash;because the
heroine of her novel insisted on eloping with
the villain instead of the hero&mdash;when she
thought of making a story out of Patricia’s
long-lost letters from “R.” While she was
waiting for her effort to come back to her, as
usual, she scribbled off a college tale about a
girl who had a desk with a secret drawer and
didn’t know it. The first story was accepted&mdash;and
paid for&mdash;by the magazine that had
been the goal of her ambitions all winter, and
the other had brought her a contract for a
dozen college stories to be written within a
year, on terms that made a true Bohemian
like Madeline feel fairly dizzy with sudden
wealth.</p>

<p>This splendid sequel to the hunt for Eugenia’s
theme reminded Betty of the papers
which had filled her drawer, and which, in
the rush of other excitements, she had quite
forgotten. If they had anything to do with
Patricia and “R.” perhaps Madeline might
write a sequel to her first story and score
another triumph. But examination proved
that the nearest name to Patricia mentioned
in them was prosaic Peter, and the only “R.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>a Robert Wales who signed one of the papers
in the minor rôle of witness for Peter’s signature.
Betty was interested at discovering her
surname; but prosy old documents make dull
reading, even if witnessed by a possible ancestor.
However, she finally sent them to
Madeline, for, as she told Georgia Ames, you
never can tell what a literary person will see
in the most commonplace things.</p>

<p>Of course Madeline was overjoyed at the
happy outcome of the Tally-ho’s crisis, and so
was Babbie, who appeared in Harding with
the very earliest signs of spring.</p>

<p>“Florida was duller than ever this year,”
she told Betty. “I’ve left mother in Washington
waiting for really warm weather, and
I’ve come to see about my branch of the
Tally-ho. I’m sure it needs my personal attention.
Mr. Thayer certainly ought to give
the poor stocking-makers ice-cream for staying
in and learning their lessons now that it’s
getting to be nice weather. You’re not a bit
enterprising about working up business
through the night-school, Betty.”</p>

<p>“I have to leave that to you,” Betty told
her solemnly. “The regular affairs of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>tea-shop, and Mr. Morton, are all that I can
manage. The ploshkins will be here to-morrow
in full force, and Mr. Morton has written
to know if we can’t think of some small improvements
that can be made next week during
the spring vacation. He can’t bear to
wait until summer for everything.”</p>

<p>“As if this place wasn’t just about perfect
now!” said Babbie scornfully.</p>

<p>But Mary Brooks, appearing in the midst
of the discussion, took a different view.
“You’ve got to keep making them sit up and
take notice of something new over and over
and over,” she announced. “That’s business.
The ploshkins will do for one thing, but if
the Morton millions are fairly languishing to
be wasted on this property, you ought to be
able to think of some features to spend them
on. Just wait a minute&mdash;I have it&mdash;a tea-garden!
Pagoda effects scattered over the
side yard. Lattice work, and thatched roofs,
Japanese screens to keep out the sun and the
stares of the gaping crowd, and lanterns for
evenings. I’m sure it would take.”</p>

<p>“It’s commonplace compared to what I’ve
thought of,” declared Babbie proudly. “What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>we want is a Peter Pan Annex in our elm
trees. I presume you’ve never been to the
original Café Robinson, Mary, but we have,
and it’s way beyond any tea-garden.”</p>

<p>Betty was in the window, peering out at
the Harding elm trees.</p>

<p>“We could,” she declared. “I always
wondered how those two trees happened to be
so close together, and now it seems like fate
that they’re exactly right for a Café Robinson.”</p>

<p>“And easily tall enough for three stories,”
cried Babbie, joining her.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t forget the big one-two-three
signs for the stories,” chimed in Betty excitedly.</p>

<p>“Nor the basket to pull up with the extra
things,” added Babbie.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell Nora to have some extra things
in every order so they can all have the fun of
hauling up the basket.”</p>

<p>“The view will be perfectly lovely from
the top,” declared Babbie. “And isn’t it fine
that our trees are in such a sheltered place, behind
the little white house?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “If Bob were here she’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>shin up to the top this very minute and tell
us what you can see.”</p>

<p>“But Babe will surely say she likes the
second story best, because she and John made
up their quarrel in the second story,” laughed
Babbie; and then they settled down to telling
the bewildered Mary about the house-in-the-trees
café that they had discovered near
Paris, and how the going-away party held
there for Madeline had developed into an announcement
party for Babe. And of course
Mary agreed that a Peter Pan Annex was the
only thing for the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.</p>

<p>“And as Madeline won’t let me call my
night-school a branch of the business, I shall
write her how I thought up this,” Babbie declared.
“I will also hunt up that comical
carpenter that Madeline had such times with
last fall, and show him how to build it.”</p>

<p>Now carpentry and the supervision of carpentry
are no work for a woman; and the
Tally-ho’s trees were in plain sight from Mr.
Thayer’s office windows. So it was only
natural, when Babbie’s slender figure appeared
on the lawn for the purpose of supervision,
that Mr. Thayer should join her for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>the purpose of applying an understanding
masculine intelligence and a firm masculine
will to the direction of the thickest-headed
carpenter imaginable. Babbie had a careless
fashion of running out on the rawest day
without a wrap. This made it all the more
necessary for Mr. Thayer to come over,
bringing his sweater to throw across her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I saw your Cousin Austin at Palm
Beach,” Babbie had explained shortly after
her arrival in Harding, “and then at St.
Augustine. At Miami he took us on the
loveliest cruise, and I drove his car at sixty
miles an hour on the beach at Ormond. It
was ripping fun. Not many men will risk
your losing your head and smashing them up.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you ever lose your head?” inquired
Mr. Thayer blandly.</p>

<p>“Not over your Cousin Austin,” said Babbie,
with a flash of a smile.</p>

<p>After that Mr. Thayer came oftener and
stayed longer. Babbie assured Betty and
Emily Davis that they had no idea how complicated
a Peter Pan Annex seemed to an untraveled
carpenter of Harding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>“We’re so afraid it won’t have the real
French air,” she said. “That’s why we spend
such ages in staring at it from all possible
angles.”</p>

<p>“And then it must be perfectly secure,” she
explained on another occasion, just after she
and Mr. Thayer had sat for almost an hour in
the top story, among the branches that now
made a most beautiful feathery screen.
“Think how horrible it would be if the railing
was too low and some silly little freshman
fell out, or if the floor wasn’t strong enough
and gave way. Mr. Thayer knows all about
such things. He’s taking a lot of interest.
We never could have done it properly except
for him.”</p>

<p>But in spite of the accommodating slowness
and stupidity of the untraveled carpenter,
the Peter Pan Annex was finished at last.</p>

<p>“I’m a candidate now for the Perfect
Patron’s Society,” Mr. Thayer told Betty, “so
I want to give an opening-day tea up on the
top floor for all the owners, managers, assistant
managers, and small sisters. It’s to be
this afternoon at four. I also want another
stocking factory party, and hadn’t we better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>get it off our hands early, before commencement
begins to loom up ahead?” Mr. Thayer
looked very hard at Betty. “I suppose you
are terribly busy?”</p>

<p>“Terribly,” returned Betty gravely, “but I
think Babbie will help.”</p>

<p>Babbie would not.</p>

<p>“I’m going to your Cousin Austin’s Adirondack
camp,” she explained, “to see spring
come in the woods. Mother is the chaperon,
and I have an awful suspicion that I am a
sort of guest of honor. Anyway, the spring
part of it appeals to me. And secondly,
mother has been solemnly promised a reunion
with her long-lost daughter.”</p>

<p>Later in the day Babbie, in a kimono,
which is the attire of confidential intercourse,
complained that “Mummy was as bad as
Margot about a multi-millionaire,” and that
she hated the woods in spring; they were
always hot, and smoky from forest fires, there
was no shade and no shooting, and the canoes
leaked from being dry all winter.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” added Babbie wearily, a “so-called
camp, with a butler and three other
men, and a sunken garden, is going too much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>for me. But when mummy really insists, the
laws of the Medes and Persians aren’t in it.”
She gave a funny little mirthless laugh. “I
suppose one ought to be very sure that one
isn’t foolishly prejudiced against the popular
idea of the idle rich.”</p>

<p>So Emily planned the factory party with
much energy and originality, and Mr. Thayer
was duly grateful. But his rare smile came
only when Betty showed him a note from
Babbie, inquiring carefully about the date of
the party and stating in a postscript, with
vehement underlining, that she never wanted
to see spring come in anybody’s woods again.</p>

<p>“There are mosquitoes, and other things
much worse,” ended Babbie enigmatically,
with the blackest possible lines under the last
two words.</p>

<p>“Suppose you let me write her about the
date of the party?” suggested Mr. Thayer.
“Then you needn’t bother.”</p>

<p>Evidently the change in correspondents did
not displease Babbie seriously, for she was
back on the appointed day, with a bewitching
smile, flashed out from beneath a bewitching
hat, for all her stocking factory friends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>including Mr. Thayer. The party was a sort
of spring fête held out on the grounds of the
factory, in the late afternoon and early evening.
There were folk dances in costume,
national songs, and old-country games. Emily
had made all the guests feel a tremendous
pride in doing whatever they could to entertain
the rest, and everything, from the Irish
bag-pipe music to the Russian mazurkas, went
off with great spirit.</p>

<p>It was while Jimmie O’Ferrel was dancing
a jig with all his might and main, and
with all eyes fastened upon his flying feet,
that Betty, happening to glance across the
grounds, saw a bewitching hat slip swiftly
from the fence top down on the tea-shop side.
But she had no proof that Mr. Thayer was
concerned in the disappearance of the hat,
until the smallest sister sought her out importantly,
a little later.</p>

<p>“Do you want to know what I think?”
she asked. “Well, I think Babbie and Mr.
Thayer are in love.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?” asked Betty
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Because,” explained Dorothy, “I ran up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>in the Peter Pan Annex just now to see how
small people look ’way down here from ’way
up there, and I jumped ’most out of my skin
’cause there those two sat. They never saw
me at all, and he had his arm around her and
she didn’t care. She was smiling about it.
So I came straight away. Was that right?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed Betty. “You hadn’t
been invited.”</p>

<p>“I was invited to Mr. Thayer’s party,
though,” objected Dorothy, “and now he isn’t
here. He’s over at our house. That’s queer.”</p>

<p>Up in the Peter Pan Annex Mr. Thayer
was saying to Babbie, “I must go back before
any one misses me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go back,” said Babbie sadly. “I
tore my dress dreadfully getting over the
fence. You shouldn’t have made me do it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t make you,” retorted Mr. Thayer.
“I particularly advised you to go around.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed Babbie, “and that made
me want to go over. Dear me! Do you suppose
we shall ever really quarrel on account of
my not wanting to give in to your chin?”</p>

<p>“No, because I shall always want to give
in to yours,” Mr. Thayer told her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t let you give in always,”
declared Babbie. “I should take turns giving
in.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘should,’” objected Mr. Thayer.
“Say ‘shall.’ Haven’t we settled it?”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Babbie gave a comical little
sigh. “It feels so queer to be settled&mdash;and
so very nice. Now go back to your party,
and I’ll get Nora to lend me some pins so I
can go back too. Oh, and we’ll tell Betty,
shan’t we, right away?”</p>

<p>Under the circumstances Betty wasn’t extremely
surprised, but she was extremely
pleased.</p>

<p>“Now our tea-room is as successful as the
famous one that belonged to the cousins of
the girl who lives over Mrs. Bob,” she
laughed. “It has produced an engagement,
and a literary career to match the artist person’s.”</p>

<p>Babbie frowned. “You mustn’t leave
yourself out, Betty. You’re mixed up in
everything, and I don’t believe that other
tea-room was half as nice as this or made half
as much money.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” agreed Betty happily.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>“I’m perfectly satisfied with my profits,
though they’re not so extraordinary as yours
and Madeline’s. Every morning when I unlock
the door I’m in such a hurry to look in
and see that everything is all right and all
here. It’s so pretty and I love it so, that I’m
afraid it will vanish some night like a fairy
palace.”</p>

<p>It was odd that the very next morning
when Betty unlocked the door, she should
find that some marauder had been there before
her. She had locked her desk the night
before, as she always did. But during the
night the lid had been forced back, the
papers in the pigeonholes tossed out on to
the floor, the drawers opened and emptied.</p>

<p>Her face was white and frightened as she
rushed over to find Babbie, who was staying
in the little white house this time.</p>

<p>“The tea-room has been robbed!” she
gasped. “Come over there, quick.”</p>

<p>Babbie, who always breakfasted late, was
pinning her collar, and she gave a start that
jabbed the pin straight into her thumb.
“Ouch, but that hurt!” she groaned.
“What did they take?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“I was so frightened I didn’t stop to see.
I thought they might be hiding in the loft.”</p>

<p>Babbie dropped a skirt over her head, and
started down the stairs, hooking it up as she
ran.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t do that. They’d want to
escape in the dark,” she called back encouragingly.</p>

<p>But at the door of the tea-shop she paused.
“There is something moving up there,” she
whispered cautiously. “See! Over in that
corner by the curtain.”</p>

<p>Betty couldn’t see anything moving, but
when Babbie started in a hasty retreat toward
the little white house she banged to the big
door and followed. Just then Bridget came
waddling breathlessly up the hill.</p>

<p>“Wat’s up now, Misses?” she called.
“Why are yez afther shuttin’ of me out?”</p>

<p class="p2b">Bridget’s fat figure was very reassuring.
Simultaneously Betty and Babbie ran toward
it, gasping out the news.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="400" alt="“COME ALONG NOW”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“COME ALONG NOW”</p>

<p class="p2">“In the loft? Well, we’ll finish ’em thin.”
Bridget seized a brass-handled poker, the
latest addition to the tea-shop’s stock of antiques.
Then she laid it down again, carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>removed her neat black bonnet, and as carefully
laid it on a table. “No use of spilin’
that in a fight. Come along now wid yez,”
she ordered.</p>

<p>Betty seized an umbrella that some one had
opportunely left in a corner, and Babbie chose
as weapon a tall brass candlestick. Then the
procession started, Bridget waddling and
wheezing in front, Betty, still white with
terror, following, and Babbie, beginning to
smile again at the absurdity of the search,
bringing up the rear. But they hunted conscientiously,
exploring every hiding-place
into which a man could possibly squeeze himself
and some that would have cramped a self-respecting
cat.</p>

<p>“They ain’t here at all,” announced
Bridget at last, removing her eye from a knot-hole
in the wall into which she had been spying
laboriously, and standing upright with
more puffings and pantings. “It’s downstairs
we go. Thim stalls are foine for
burgulars, and mebbe they’re in me kitchen
this minute, ating up me angil-food that ’ud
riz light as a feather. Oh me, oh me.”</p>

<p>“They aren’t here now. I’m sure they’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>not,” protested Babbie. “Think how absurd
it would be for a burglar to hide in here, just
waiting around to be caught. I’m going to
see what we’ve lost.”</p>

<p>Bridget persisted in completing her search,
and Betty would not desert her. But when
the fat cook was satisfied and had sat down to
fan herself into a semblance of calmness that
would make possible the successful cooking of
waffles for the “Why-Get-Up-to-Breakfast
Club,” Betty joined Babbie, and together they
straightened out and looked over the papers
from the desk.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing gone. Of course they
wouldn’t want grocer’s bills, even if they
were receipted,” Betty declared. “But I left
six dollars and thirty cents all rolled up in one
of the top drawers. Emily forgot it when she
went to the bank. I suppose they’ve got that.”</p>

<p>“Drawer wide open, and one&mdash;five&mdash;yes,
six dollars and thirty cents all here,” Babbie
reported. “That’s very queer. Burglars that
hunt as hard as this and then don’t take the
money when they find it are certainly particular.
Well, did they like our old brasses,
I wonder, or our plated silver spoons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>But the candlesticks&mdash;except the one Babbie
had seized upon&mdash;and the Flemish lamps
were all in place. The gargoyles grinned
serenely from their accustomed niches. The
silver drawer had not been tampered with.
In the kitchen the angel-food was just as
Bridget had left it.</p>

<p>“It’s a mystery,” declared Babbie at last,
“a thrilling and impenetrable mystery.
When do burglars not burgle?”</p>

<p>“When they are frightened off,” answered
Betty prosaically.</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t have taken a second to
dip out that money,” Babbie objected. “It
was all mussed up, so some one’s hand must
have been in there, since you left it in a
roll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, in a tight little wad,” put in Betty.</p>

<p>“And that some one could have pulled
back his hand full just as quickly as empty,”
Babbie went on. “I tell you it’s a horrible
mystery. I’m going to ask Robert to come
over this minute and see about it.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Emily, who had been doing the
day’s marketing, arrived; but neither she nor
Mr. Thayer could solve the “thrilling, impenetrable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
horrible” mystery, though Mr.
Thayer found “jimmy” marks on the shed
door, and that, as Betty said, proved beyond
a doubt that the burglars had been the real
thing.</p>

<p>“Real, but very eccentric,” laughed Emily.
“Let’s hope that all the Tally-ho’s burglars
will belong to the same accommodating tribe.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AMAZING MR. SMITH AND OTHER<br />
AMAZEMENTS</span></h2></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Rachel Morrison?</span> No, not yet, but she’s
coming. Everybody’s coming.”</p>

<p>“K. Kittredge is as comical as ever. Ask
her about her prize English pupil.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, you’re glad to see everybody
these days. Why, Jean Eastman rushed
up to me, and I fell upon her neck. Digs
and freaks and snobs and all, they belong to
19&mdash; and the good old days.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel that way too? I wondered if
any one else had noticed the horrid little
changes. I suppose things will change, but
I wish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Look at this tea-shop. It’s a
change all right, and for my part I don’t see
how we should live without it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is different. This is 19&mdash;’s
very own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s Betty Wales, anyway? She’s so
busy you can’t get within a mile of her.”</p>

<p>Thus 19&mdash;, over its ices in the Peter Pan
Annex. The Tally-ho Tea-Shop was 19&mdash;’s
headquarters, official and unofficial. There
they breakfasted, lunched, tea-ed, and dined;
there held informal “sings” and rallies, and
there on the last evening of the festal week
they were to eat their class supper. The tenth
year class were to eat theirs in the loft. The
fifteeners had engaged the first floor of the
Peter Pan Annex, and the six graduates of the
very oldest class were to lunch up in the top
floor, among the tree-tops. No wonder that
Betty was busy and had to be caught on the
wing and forcibly detained by 19&mdash; friends.
Commencement guests fairly beset the Tally-ho
at meal-times. Between meals old girls and
belated undergraduates thronged the tables.
Betty could hardly believe her eyes when she
counted up one day’s returns from the Peter
Pan Annex. As for ploshkins, the first order
had sold out almost before it was unpacked,
and every class in college had wanted to adopt
the ploshkin for its class animal. But Betty
explained that 19&mdash; had already secured it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>Madeline had had that happy thought, of
course, and Kate Denise, who was chairman
of the supper committee, had capped it by ordering
miniature ploshkins for favors and a
mammoth one for a centerpiece. Then Madeline
had written a ploshkin song which was so
much cleverer than “The Bay Where the
Ploshkin Bides,” that the Glee Club groaned
with envy. There was also a 19&mdash; song called
“Tea-Shop,” and one called “The House of
Peter Pan,” so that Betty’s enterprises were
much in the public eye, if she was not.</p>

<p>It was dreadfully hard to stick to work, when
you knew that 19&mdash; was having a “Stunt-doers’
Meet” under the apple-trees on the back
campus, or Dramatic Club’s Alumnæ tea, also
with “stunts,” was on in the Students’ Building.
The only consolation lay in the fact that
your dearest friends calmly cut these surpassing
attractions, to which some of them had
traveled thousands of miles, just to sit by the
cashier’s desk in the Tally-ho Tea-Shop, and
talk to the cashier in her intervals of comparative
leisure, waiting patiently while she made
change, found tables for helpless or hurried
customers, took “rush orders” to the kitchen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>when the waitresses were all too busy, and in
general made things “go” in the steady, plodding,
systematic fashion that her gay little soul
loathed. But she realized that she had made
a success of the Tally-ho just by keeping at it,
and she was going home next week with little
Dorothy and “money in her pocket,” in Will’s
slangy phraseology, leaving Emily to take
charge of the improvements which Madeline
and Mr. Morton had planned on a scale of
elegance that fairly took away Betty’s breath,
and of the remnants of business that would be
left when the hungry Harding girls had departed,
and sleepy silence reigned on the deserted
campus.</p>

<p>Eugenia Ford came in one afternoon early
in commencement week, looking very meek and
unhappy.</p>

<p>“I’m going home to-night. I was foolish
to plan to stay over, but a senior I know asked
me to, and I thought of course she meant it.
And she only let me entertain her youngest
brother part of one morning, and made me
give her my ticket to the senior play.”</p>

<p>“What a shame!” Betty sympathized.</p>

<p>“But I was to blame. I was a goose,” Eugenia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
repeated. “I ought to have known that
she only wanted to get something out of me.
If I rush up to people all of a sudden, when
I’ve never noticed them much before, I generally
want to get something out of them. It’s
naturally the same with other girls.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “Better stick to the ones
who are always nice to you&mdash;your real friends,”
she advised.</p>

<p>“But then you won’t get on,” objected Eugenia
wisely. “They say you’ve got to scheme
a lot to be in things here. You’ve got to make
yourself known.”</p>

<p>“Why not just try to be worth knowing?”
Betty suggested. “My friend Rachel Morrison
was as quiet and&mdash;and&mdash;unpushing as could
be, but she was so bright and nice and thoughtful
for other people and so reliable that everybody
wanted her for a friend.”</p>

<p>Eugenia sighed. “I’m not bright or
thoughtful for others. I&mdash;oh, dear, this isn’t
what I came to talk about, Miss Wales. I&mdash;I
stopped to say good-bye to Dorothy. I&mdash;she&mdash;we
made up. I mean&mdash;we hadn’t exactly
quarreled, so we couldn’t exactly make up.
But I felt so ashamed. Being mean to little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>girls makes you feel so ashamed&mdash;even if they
don’t know about it. Miss Wales, I’ve heard
about the dormitory for poor girls&mdash;Morton
Hall. When I went home in the spring my
father said that as far as he could see you’d
taught me about all the sensible things I’d
learned this year. He asked me what you’d
like for a present. I couldn’t decide, but
when I heard about the dormitory I wrote
and asked him to send you a check for extra
things, you know, for the furnishings, or to
pay part of some girl’s board. I thought perhaps
you’d rather have that&mdash;from us&mdash;than
something for yourself.” She put three
checks into Betty’s hand. “Two of my best
friends sent the others. It was what they
had left from their spring term allowances.
Susanna would like hers to go for a
picture in the house parlor. Molly doesn’t
care.”</p>

<p>Eugenia rushed through all this information
so fast that Betty had no chance to interrupt,
and at the end she was speechless with
surprise. She glanced at the checks. The
smallest was for a hundred dollars. Together
they would provide endless “extras” for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>Morton Hall, or help dozens of poor girls to
make both ends meet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Eugenia, you are a dear,” she cried
impulsively. “And your father is a dear too,
and these other girls. But why not give it
right to the college yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Because you’ll think of something nicer
than they would to do with it. Anyway it’s
a sort of a present to you&mdash;father’s part.
You’re just to say it’s from friends of yours.
We don’t want our names mentioned. You’re
the one who put the idea into my head.
We’re not doing it for anything but to please
you, and Susanna and Molly because they
liked the idea, and what was the use keeping
over their allowances?”</p>

<p>Betty was glad of this explanation. She
had tried to choke back an ugly little suspicion
that this gift might be a part of Eugenia’s
campaign to “make herself known,” by having
her father’s name linked with Mr. Morton’s
as a benefactor of Harding. Now she was
reassured on that point, and she thanked
Eugenia again, trying to make her feel how
much the money would accomplish.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so,” Eugenia agreed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>“and we shan’t any of us miss it. Lots of
the girls could give away more than they do,
Miss Wales, only they never think of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same way about helping the ones
who are rather left out to have some good
times,” Betty put in eagerly. “It doesn’t
take much effort or time from your own fun,
and it means such a lot to them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Eugenia agreed soberly. “I’m
going to try to be more like that next year.
It’s horrid to be as snippy as most of our
crowd are. Some awfully nice girls are left
out of things for one reason or another. We
should all have more fun, I guess, if we all
had it,” ended Eugenia rather obscurely.
“Good-bye, Miss Wales, until next fall.”</p>

<p>Betty was wondering busily whether she
should be back next fall, for mother had just
written that father’s business was improving
fast and that he hoped to have the family
together again soon, when the supper committee
appeared to inquire about the shape of
the 19&mdash; table and to consult the president
about the seating arrangements. Betty was
deep in the problem of how to get all the
speakers on one side of the table and yet not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>separate them from their friends, when a
strange gentleman walked in and came
straight up to Betty’s desk.</p>

<p>“Miss Wales?” he inquired in businesslike
tones.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Wales.” Betty stood up behind
the desk, and Kate Denise and the rest withdrew
to a window until the man should have
finished his business with Betty.</p>

<p>“My name is Smith,” he went on. “I represent
Furbush, a Boston antique shop.
You’ve heard of it, I presume?”</p>

<p>Betty had not heard of Furbush’s.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not vital,” Mr. Smith told her
smilingly, “because we buy on a cash basis, so
it’s not a question of our credit. I should
have said that I’m up here buying old furniture.
I heard you had a rather good desk
that you might like to sell, and some pieces
of brass.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have those things, but we don’t
care to sell any of them,” Betty told him
shortly. The idea of any one’s coming to
buy the Tally-ho’s most prized features, and
in commencement week too, when every
minute was precious. Mr. Smith’s hand was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>on the desk, but now he looked down as if he
had but just discovered the fact.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the desk I was told about,
isn’t it?” he said, and came around to
Betty’s side to see it to better advantage.
“It’s a good piece&mdash;a very good piece. I’ll
give you a good price for it, Miss Wales.
Just name your figure.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, for the desk belongs to the
firm&mdash;the tea-shop firm,” Betty answered.
“And if we should even decide to sell,&mdash;though
I don’t think we shall&mdash;two friends
of ours are ready to give us the full value of
the desk.”</p>

<p>“Now what would you consider the full
value of the desk, Miss Wales?” Mr. Smith
asked, in a tone that was meant to be half
persuasive and half scornful of Miss Wales’s
knowledge of antiques.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, and it doesn’t matter
at all, because we don’t wish to sell the
desk or anything else that we have.” Betty’s
tone was meant to be wholly anxious for the
immediate departure of the importunate Mr.
Smith.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you four hundred dollars for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>that desk, Miss Wales. That’s about five
times what you paid for it, I guess, and twice
what your friends would give. Furbush’s
can pay top prices for a thing they like, because
their customers are the top-price sort.”</p>

<p>Betty was inwardly amazed, both at the
sum Mr. Smith offered and at the accuracy of
his guesses about the price Madeline had paid
and the advance Mrs. Bob had offered. But
she reflected that if Furbush’s, of which she
had never heard, would pay four hundred
dollars for the desk to-day they probably
would pay that or nearly that later in the
week. Babbie was off walking with Mr.
Thayer, whom she was keeping very much in
the background because only Betty and the
other two B’s were to know of the engagement
until class supper night, when Babbie
meant to run around the table with the other
engaged girls. And Madeline had not yet
torn herself away from her beloved studio
apartment, where her latest diversion was
papering her study with “rejection slips”
from over-fastidious editors. The desk certainly
could not be sold at any price without
Madeline’s consent. So in the face of Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>Smith’s munificent offer, Betty preserved a
stony silence which finally evoked a low
whistle from that gentleman.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, slipping his hand lovingly
across the carved panels and the inlaid
fronts of the little drawers. “If you feel
that way about it, Furbush must do without.
Now have you the same objections to selling
me a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you can have tea here,” Betty
told him. “If you will sit down at one of
the tables you will be served directly.” Then
she turned her attention to Kate and the
others, and forgot all about Mr. Smith, who
chose a retired nook in Flying Hoof’s stall,
ordered tea with three kinds of sandwiches,
pulled a book out of his pocket, and explained
to the waitress that he liked to eat
slowly and read, without being disturbed.</p>

<p>The supper committee worked out its seating
plan and departed, highly indignant that
Betty wouldn’t come up to the campus with
them to pay calls on the lesser stars of the
senior play cast, who were on exhibition in
their make-ups.</p>

<p>“I’m lucky to get off to-night for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>play,” Betty told them sternly, and in the
pause before dinner she tried to concentrate
her mind on preparing a menu for the next
day. She needed to consult Bridget about
several items, and as the tea-room was quite
empty and she would only be gone a minute
she slipped out without calling in Emily, who
was busy in the kitchen, to take her place at
the desk. When she came back she was
startled to find her chair occupied by Mr.
Smith, who had opened several drawers and
was poking the fan-shaped panel, trying
vainly to push it to one side. Betty stared
at him for a moment in amazement, then she
called out loudly, “I thought you had gone,
Mr. Smith,” keeping meanwhile close to the
kitchen door which separated her from
Bridget, Nora, and Emily, for she had no
idea what a man might do when you caught
him robbing your desk.</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith was not even disconcerted.
“Oh, no, Miss Wales,” he began easily.
“Don’t you remember I haven’t paid for my
grub? I’m not the sort of man to go off without
paying my bill. I’d finished, and you
weren’t here, so I was taking a last lingering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>look at your lovely desk. Seems to me as if
there might be a secret drawer behind one of
these panels.” He tapped the panels gently,
one after another, with his knuckles.</p>

<p>“If we ever decide to sell you the desk, Mr.
Smith, you can examine it as closely as you
like,” Betty told him with dignity. “But now
I must ask you to leave it alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” Mr. Smith answered absently,
still fingering the carved panel in the
center.</p>

<p>As Betty watched him indignantly, a
dreadful thought came into her head. The
three checks that Eugenia had given her
were on the desk. She had tucked them
carelessly under the blotter, meaning to take
them out again as soon as Kate and the others
had gone. Betty did not stop to consider how
useless they would be to Mr. Smith. She
only reflected that he was certainly dishonorable,
and probably dishonest, and that the
checks were a sacred trust. Mr. Smith was
absorbed in the arrangements of the desk.
Betty slipped silently through the kitchen
door and approached Bridget.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but I think there’s a burglar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>in there,” she whispered. “He’s at the desk,
and he won’t get away from it. I want you
to scare him into another part of the room,
and then bar the door until I’ve found out
whether or not he’s stolen anything. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Aisy,” returned Bridget calmly, wiping
her hands on her apron, and seizing a poker
and a rolling-pin she marched boldly into the
tea-room.</p>

<p>“Scat!” she hissed into the ear of the
astonished Mr. Smith, who jumped back like
a frightened rabbit when he saw the poker
and the rolling-pin brandished dangerously
about his head. In a minute Bridget had
him prisoned in Flying Hoof’s stall, in front
of which she danced back and forth, waving
her improvised weapons frantically.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him,” she called triumphantly to
Betty. “An’ if he’s a burgular fur shure, I’ll
kape him safe while Miss Emily do be runnin’
for the perlice.”</p>

<p>It took Betty only an instant to put her
hand under the blotter, and there, just as she
had left them, were the three checks.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bridget, he’s not a burglar,” she cried.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>“The money is here all right. Let him out
the door. I’m sorry, Mr. Smith,” she added
with dignity, “but you certainly acted like
a thief, so you mustn’t blame me, since I knew
that there was a large amount of money in
the desk, for treating you like one.”</p>

<p>“Indade it’s a good whack yez desarve for
troublin’ me lovely young ladies,” declared
Bridget, reluctantly moving to one side to let
her prisoner pass out.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, scowling angrily, walked across
to the desk that had been the cause of all the
trouble, and threw down the slip Nora had
given him and the change to pay it.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity if a gentleman can’t satisfy his
idle curiosity about the date of an antique
desk without being taken for a sneak thief,”
he declaimed angrily, as he started off.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity when a gintlemin ain’t got
enough bisniss of his own to mind so it’ll kape
his nose out of other people’s private propity,”
cried Bridget after him, and then she turned
her attention to comforting Betty, who had
been dreadfully frightened by the episode.</p>

<p>“I almost wish the desk was sold,” she declared
with a sob in her voice. “It’s always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>making us trouble with its queer old secret
drawers and the people that try to steal out of
it&mdash;and don’t.”</p>

<p>“It’s a foine desk that burgulars can’t burgle,
I’m thinkin’,” Bridget declared consolingly.</p>

<p>“But it attracts burglars,” Betty objected,
“and being frightened is almost as bad as being
really robbed.”</p>

<p>Madeline, who came that evening, fairly
gloated in the mysterious robbery and the
strange conduct of Mr. Smith. “It’s like living
in a detective story,” she declared. “Mr.
Smith was hunting for something, and so
were the burglars,&mdash;something so valuable
that they turned up their noses at six good
round dollars. Those old papers can’t be
valuable. Therefore it stands to reason that
there must be something else in there that
we haven’t found&mdash;jewels, maybe, worth a
king’s ransom. As soon as I’ve embraced
dear old 19&mdash;, I’ll have another hunt.”</p>

<p>But embracing dear old 19&mdash; was a more absorbing
process than Madeline had counted it.
Class supper night, the grand wind-up of Harding
commencement, arrived, and she had not
given another thought to the hidden treasure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">A FINAL EXCITEMENT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first Betty had not seen how she could
possibly be spared from “business” on the
most strenuous night in the Tally-ho’s history,
with three class suppers being eaten at
once in its precincts, a chef from Boston lording
it over Bridget in the kitchen,&mdash;or trying
to, and a little army of strange waitresses to
be shown the way about. But 19&mdash; was
firm; its president must and should sit
through the whole supper on the right hand
of Eleanor Watson, who was toast-mistress
again this year; must present the mammoth
ploshkin to T. Reed’s adorable young
son, and the silver loving-cup to the real
class-baby, the daughter of a certain Mary
Jones, who had never in all her college
course done anything less commonplace than
her name. On the day after commencement
she had married a Harding lawyer, and her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>living in town made the display of her very
small baby possible.</p>

<p>“It’s not every first year reunion that has
one right here on hand to be inspected,” declared
Katherine Kittridge. “So here’s to
Mary Jones, if she wasn’t a highly exciting
member of our highly exciting class.”</p>

<p>So Betty finally yielded to 19&mdash;’s demands
for her own and Emily’s release from duty,
put the management of the suppers into
Nora’s capable hands, and resolved to wear
the rose-colored satin dress that she had
bought in Paris and to forget for the one
night that she was anything but a “lady of
leisure” come to her class reunion, just like
Bob and Babe and Roberta, without a care in
the world or a thought beyond the joy of
being “back” with 19&mdash;. And partly, no
doubt, because the supper was so good and so
well served, she succeeded. Eleanor was
lovelier than ever, and her little speeches
cleverer; Bob, on her other side, was jollier,
Helen Adams more amusingly sedate, K.
more delightfully absurd. The toasts were
as “superfine” as all 19&mdash;’s stunts, the songs
went with a fine dash, the ploshkins made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>decided hit, and T. Reed’s little T.&mdash;it stood
for Thomas instead of Theresa&mdash;was so dear
and comical, trying to pull his big ploshkin
off the table, and finally insisting on a chair
for it between himself and “Mother T.,”
as everybody called her now. Betty realized
suddenly that she hadn’t had many “good
times” this year, and that she had missed
them. Then she forgot everything but the
perfectly splendid time she was having right
now, in the old care-free Betty Wales fashion.
She counted the minutes jealously, and
sighed all to herself when the last toast was
over&mdash;K’s comical eulogy of “Our Working
Women.”</p>

<p>But with the end of the supper the night’s
fun was only well started. Up the stairs to
the loft, bearing the ploshkins solemnly
above their heads, climbed 19&mdash;, to sing to
the little tenth year table; then out to the
Peter Pan Annex to salute the fifteeners and
pelt them with green carnations. The third
year reunion was up in the gym; the seniors
were in the Student’s Building. Off trailed
19&mdash;, to the tune of the ploshkin song, to return
<i>en masse</i> the serenades that had enlivened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
its own supper. Up-stairs the tenth
year people were not half-way through their
toasts. Down-stairs Nora turned the lamps
low, so that they would burn until 19&mdash; came
back for its forgotten wraps and its last good-byes.
It was a breathlessly hot night, so
Nora left all the windows open, and she and
Bridget, their duties ended, went home to
well-earned rest.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when 19&mdash;, having
serenaded all the suppers, all their favorite
faculty, all their “loved spots” on the
campus, came back in scattered ranks and
without music, for they had sung themselves
hoarse, to the Tally-ho. The other classes had
left, and the tea-shop was dusky and silent.
Betty happened to be marching in the front
rank with Babe and Roberta.</p>

<p>“I ought to have come back ahead and
lighted up for you,” she said. “I thought
Nora would stay until we got here, but it’s terribly
late, and I suppose she got sleepy.”</p>

<p>“We can hurry ahead and do it now just as
well,” declared Babe, and the three walked
swiftly up the winding path and flung open
the heavy door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>Though the lamps were turned low, they
gave light enough to see by easily, and there,
sitting at the desk, bending over the pigeonholes,
was a tall woman wearing a dark dress
and a dark, drooping hat, that, in her present
attitude, completely hid her face. The three
girls discovered the intruder at exactly the
same minute.</p>

<p>“More Blunderbuss,” murmured Babe, remembering
the mysterious robberies of senior
year. “Do you know her, Betty?”</p>

<p>“No,” Betty answered quickly.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll just hang on to her till we see
what she’s taken,” cried Babe impulsively,
and launched herself fearlessly at the stranger,
while Roberta screamed; a relay of girls appearing
in the door just then rushed to Babe’s
assistance, and Betty, not knowing what else
to do, turned up all the lamps.</p>

<p>The tall, black-gowned woman was unusually
strong, but she was no match for eight
stalwart and determined members of 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>“I give up. Don’t smother me so,” she
cried after a minute in a queer, deep voice.
Her hat had been knocked off in the struggle,
and the short hair and unmistakably masculine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
features that were revealed matched the
deep voice and the manly strength.</p>

<p>“Why, she’s a&mdash;a man,” cried Roberta, and
redoubled her shrieks of terror.</p>

<p>The man, still held firmly by his captors,
struggled to his feet. “Shut up, can’t you?”
he demanded angrily of Roberta. “Call the
police if you want to, but don’t wake all the
dogs and babies in the neighborhood, and for
pity’s sake”&mdash;to the others&mdash;“don’t squeeze
my arms so. It’s not ladylike.”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously the girls loosened
their hold a little, and the prisoner, making
one supreme effort, dashed straight at the terrified
Roberta, who stood near the door, and in
another moment was out in the dark, running
like a deer for the factory fence. When he
climbed over the top, they could just see that
he had left his skirt behind.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a crazy ending for a sedate
little class supper,” declared Babe, sorrowfully
inspecting a great tear in her lace-trimmed
skirt.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it queer how, when you knew it was
a man, you couldn’t hold so tight?” questioned
Christy Mason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>“We ought to have chased him,” cried
Roberta, to the vast amusement of the rest.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t pay,” Betty put in, “for there’s
nothing of value here that he could take away,
and nothing in the desk that any one would
want.” She stopped to examine it. “Why!”
she cried in dismay. “It’s been sawed off, all
the top part, and put back again. Look,
Madeline!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the top of the desk had been
sawed off just below the drawers, and then cut
into three sections, which had finally been laid
in place again, so that at first sight the damage
would not be noticed.</p>

<p>“The vandal!” cried Madeline. “He’s
ruined our prize feature. And what was his
idea? Oh, I see! He couldn’t find the
springs, and this was his hateful way of getting
into the secret drawers. Do let’s count them.
Two&mdash;four&mdash;that’s all. Then there wasn’t another
drawer filled with a king’s ransom in
pearls for him to make off with. That’s certainly
a relief.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Madeline, do tell us what you mean,”
came with one voice from the crowd of wide-eyed
girls; and with many promptings from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>Betty and Babbie Madeline told the story of
the secret drawers through all its exciting
stages, ending with her theory of the hidden
jewels as a possible motive for all the queer
robberies.</p>

<p>“But that was evidently a little too wonderful,”
she added, “though for that matter
the real explanation may be even more
remarkable. I await suggestions.”</p>

<p>These came thick and fast, but the best one
was from Christy Mason. “Those papers
that Betty found are very likely to be what
they want to decide the ownership of some
big estate or valuable lands. Old wills and
deeds are often very important. But why
don’t they ask for them, instead of trying to
steal them?”</p>

<p>Madeline stared. “That rubbish! Why I
think I&mdash;&mdash; Well, it doesn’t matter, because
the waste-basket is as safe as any other
place while I’m away. When I packed to
come up here I think I tossed them into it,
but I’m perfectly sure I didn’t empty the
basket. I never do till it overflows. I’ll rush
off on the six ten to-morrow&mdash;no, this morning,
and I’ll telegraph you, Betty; Dick will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>know, or father’s lawyer, if the papers are the
prize package. Good-bye, all you dear old
19&mdash;’s.”</p>

<p>So 19&mdash;’s collective farewells were said
amid wild excitement, and half the class
waited over to be at the Tally-ho next morning
when Madeline’s telegram was delivered:
“Papers safe in waste-basket. Two thousand
dollars reward.”</p>

<p>This was thrilling, but tantalizingly incomplete;
19&mdash; departed gaily with its half-loaf,
having made Betty promise to indite a
round robin to the class explaining the whole
affair.</p>

<p>“For it’s very much our affair,” Christy
declared. “And don’t you write until you
can explain every single thing, Betty.”</p>

<p>It was only a day later, as it happened,
when Betty had the whole story. It seemed
that the deed signed by “Peter” and witnessed
by Robert Wales was wanted, exactly as
Christy had guessed, to determine the ownership
of a property worth many millions;
and the lawyers of the rightful heirs had
offered a large reward for its recovery.
Meanwhile a daring adventurer, who was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>trying to assert his claims to the estate, had
hired a disreputable detective agency to find
and destroy the deed. Their clever work
had traced it to its strange hiding-place, and
they had made three desperate attempts to
get hold of the paper. The fact that Mr.
Wales was a relative of the rightful heirs&mdash;Robert
and “Peter” were cousins&mdash;had made
them suspect that his daughter would know
of the search for the paper and refuse to give
it up; but they had never guessed that the
girls would have discovered and emptied the
two inner drawers, of the existence of which
nobody else knew but their client. “Mr.
Smith” did not represent any Boston antique
shop, and his knowledge of old furniture was
confined to an exhaustive special course in
the arrangement of sliding panels and secret
springs. But though this had failed him he
was a resourceful sleuth, as is proven by the
fact that just an hour after Madeline had
taken the papers to Dick Blake he appeared
at her studio apartment in the guise of the
building’s window cleaner; and it was due
only to Madeline’s prompt recognition of his
resemblance to the lady in black of the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>before, that in less than an hour more he
had been arrested, charged with despoiling
the Tally-ho desk and also with entering
Betty’s room in the little white house with
intent to take the papers if he could find
them there. For Betty had gone home to
discover her possessions in great confusion,
and Dorothy had told of waking up to find
somebody in their room who said she was the
washerwoman waiting for Betty to come and
give her the clothes.</p>

<p>“And when I said ‘you’re not our wash-woman
’cause she’s Mrs. Gibbs,’ she said she
was Mrs. Gibbs’ sister, and Mrs. Gibbs was
sick. And then I guess I was asleep again,”
Dorothy ended comprehensively.</p>

<p>From Betty’s rooms Mr. Smith had returned
empty-handed to the Tally-ho, where he had
previously succeeded in opening two drawers;
and this time he completed his search in the
most conclusive fashion that occurred to him
by laying open the whole interior of the desk.</p>

<p>It was a detective story ready-made, Madeline
declared, and promptly wrote it up, only
to have one editor tell her that it lacked reality
and the next assure her it was commonplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>“You certainly never can tell how things
will take,” complained Madeline sadly.
“That’s what Mr. Morton says. He’s as
nearly cross with you as he can be with his
dear Miss B. A., because ‘those fool splashers’
that he got some shop to order a few of are
catching on so splendidly. It’s certainly fortunate
that Bob Enderby thought of the patent,
for it seems there’s a small fortune in ploshkins.”</p>

<p>“Betty Wales and Co.” had certainly enjoyed
a successful year. Will’s salary had
been raised three times, and Nan had made a
fine record and been asked to take a party of
girls abroad for the summer. But between
tea-shop, ploshkins, and “hidden treasure,”
Betty was what Will called “most disgustingly
wealthy.” It was great fun to be able to rush
down town in Cleveland and buy the Japanese
screens and the hammock that mother wanted
for the piazza of the little cottage they had
taken for the summer in a lake-side suburb.
It was better still to be accepted joyously as
the family cook. Now that she had plenty of
money in the bank for summer clothes and
other expenses, and a steady income from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>ploshkins, it was not necessary to waste time
counting up how much her cooking saved the
family. The only disappointment came when
father absolutely refused to take her “ready
money,” after what he had said in the fall
about how every little would help.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” he told her, “and I don’t
need to now. We’ve pulled through the worst
of our business trouble, though we shan’t be
back on Easy Street for a good while yet, I’m
afraid.” And he sighed a little.</p>

<p>But Betty only laughed. “Who wants so
particularly to be back on Easy Street?” she
demanded. “It’s fun to see what you can do
when you try. I like being part of Betty
Wales and Co. I like being the cook. I shall
like helping in any other ways that turn up.”
Betty smiled a little far-away smile. “Lots
of queer things have turned up this year. I
certainly do wonder what I shall get into next.”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
